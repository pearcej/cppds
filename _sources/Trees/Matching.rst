    :match_1: tree|||Hierarchal data structure with a root, branches, and leaves.
    :match_2: AVL tree|||Binary search tree that automatically makes sure the tree remains balanced at all times
    :match_3: binary search tree|||Binary tree in which each node has no more than 2 children.
    :match_4: bst propery|||Node values in the left sub-tree are less than the parent while node values in the right sub-tree are are greater than the parent
    :match_5: Leaf node|||Node that has no children
    :match_6: root|||Starting point of the tree
    :match_7: path|||Ordered list of nodes connected by edges 
    :match_8: parent|||Node that leads to other nodes
    :match_9: max heap|||Largest key is always at the front
    :match_10: rotation|||Pivoting the parent and children nodes in a subtree to reorganize their hierarchy
    :match_11: preorder|||Recursive tree traversal in which the root node is visited, then the left, followed by the right subtree
    :match_12: postorder|||Recursive tree traversal in which the left subtree is visited, then the right, followed by the root node
    :match_13: inorder|||Recursive tree traversal in which the left subtree is visited, then the root node, followed by the right subtree
    :match_14: successor|||Replaces another node while preserving the binary search tree relationships; the next-largest key in the tree
    :match_15: subtree|||Section of a tree
    :match_16: complete binary tree|||Tree in which each level has all of its nodes, with the exception of the bottom level
    :match_17: level|||Number of edges on the path from the root to the current node
    :match_18: height|||Maximum level of any node in the tree
