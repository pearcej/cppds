    :feedback: Review classes and their properties
    :match_1: algorithm|||Step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem.
    :match_2: average case|||When an algorithm performs between its worst and best case given a certain data set or circumstance.
    :match_3: vector|||Sequence container storing data of a single type in a dynamically allocated array.
    :match_4: worst case|||When an algorithm performs especially poorly given a certain data set or circumstance.
    :match_5: quadratic|||Function describing a relationship who's highest order is a number squared
    :match_6: best case|||When an algorithm performs especially good given a certain data set or circumstance
    :match_7: Big-O notation|||another term for order of magnitude
    :match_8: brute force|||Technique that tries to exhaust all possibilities of a problem
    :match_9: contiguous|||Adjacent 
    :match_10: dynamic size|||Able to change size automatically
    :match_11: exponential|||Function represented as a number being raised to a power that increases.
    :match_12: hash table|||A collection consisting of key-value pairs with an associated hash function that maps the key to the associated value.
    :match_13: linear|||Function that grows in a one to one relationship with its input.
    :match_14: logarithmic|||functions that are the inverse of exponential functions
    :match_15: order of magnitude|||a function describing an algorithm's steps as the size of the problem increases.
