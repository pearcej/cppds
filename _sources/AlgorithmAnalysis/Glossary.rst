.. glossary::

    algorithm
        a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem

    average case
        refers to when an algorithm performs between its worst and best case given a certain data set or circumstance

    best case
        refers to when an algorithm performs especially good given a certain data set or circumstance

    Big-O notation
        another term for order of magnitude; written as :math:`O(f(n))`

    brute force
        technique that tries to exhaust all possibilities of a problem

    :code:`contains`
        A hash operation used to check if a table contains a specific element.

    contiguous
        adjacent or next to

    dynamic size
        able to change size automatically

    exponential
        function represented as a number being raised to a power that increases like :math:`f(n)= 2^{n}`

    :code:`get_item`
        A hash operation used to retrieve the information associated with a hash key.

    hash table
        a collection consisting of key-value pairs with an associated hash function that maps the key to the associated value.

    linear
        function that grows in a one to one relationship with its input like :math:`f(n) = n`

    logarithmic
        functions that are the inverse of exponential functions usually presented as :math:`f(n) = logn`

    order of magnitude
        function describing the part :math:`T(n)` that increases the fastest as the value of n increases  (a function describing an algorithm's steps as the size of the problem increases).

    quadratic
        function describing a relationship who's highest order is a number squared

          simplified: :math:`f(n) = x^{2}`

          complex: :math:`ax^{2} + bx + c`
    
    :code:`set_item`
        A hash operation used to add an item to your table.

    vector
        sequence container storing data of a single type that is stored in a dynamically allocated array which can change in size.
        
    worst case
        refers to when an algorithm performs especially poorly given a certain data set or circumstance
