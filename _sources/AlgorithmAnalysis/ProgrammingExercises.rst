Programming Exercises
---------------------



#. Devise an experiment to verify that the vector index operator is
   :math:`O(1)`

#. Devise an experiment to verify that find and insert are
   :math:`O(1)` for hash tables.

#. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the ``erase()``
   operator on vectors and hash tables.

#. Given an array of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in :math:`O(n\log(n))`
   to find the kth smallest number in the array.

#. Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain.
