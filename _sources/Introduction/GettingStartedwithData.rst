Getting Started with Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C++ considers data to be the focal point of the problem-solving process.
We stated above that C++ supports the object-oriented programming
paradigm. In C++, as well as in any other
object-oriented programming language, we define a **class** to be a
description of what the data looks like (the state) and what the data can
do (the behavior). Classes are analogous to abstract data types because
a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of a data item.
Data items are called **objects** in the object-oriented paradigm. An object
is an instance of a class.
