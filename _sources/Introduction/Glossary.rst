    abstract data type/ADT
        A mathematical model for data.

    abstraction
        Focusing on desired behaviors and properties while disregarding what is irrelevant/unimportant

    access keywords
        Keywords such as ''public'', private'', and ''protected'' that indicates what class properties/behaviors a user can change

    argument
        Data passed to a parameter.

    array
        A data structure consisting of an ordered collection of data elements of identical type in which each element can be identified by an array index.

        Used to pass an array of arguments.

    atomic data type
        Basic data type that cannot be broken down into any simpler data elements.

    base class
        A class from which other classes are derived.

    ``bool``
        Keyword for Boolean data type.

    ``char``
        Keyword for character data type that stores a single character.

    class
        A template for creating (instantiating) objects, for providing initial values for state via member variables, and for implementations of behavior via member functions or methods

    class methods
        The functions and methods that belong to a class that describe what the class can do.

    collection
        A grouping of a number of data items (possibly only zero or one) that have some shared significance or need to be operated upon together.
    
    compiler
        A program that converts high-level language into machine language.

    computable
        The capability of being copmuted or solved.

    ``const``
        Keyword that makes a variable or value immutable. i.e. constant and unchanging.

    constructor
        A class' special function that initializes an object of that class.
    
    data abstraction
        The act of only providing essential information within your work. Representing your data without reavling the details.
    
    data structure
        The organization of data that allows for improved search, storage, and sorting capability.

    data types
        A classification of various types of data, such as floating-point, integer, or Boolean, the possible values for that type,  operations that can be done on that type, 
        and how the values of that type are stored.

    dereference
        Follow a pointer to its referenced memory location and read the data there.

    derived class
        A derived class is a class created or derived from another existing class.

    ``double``
        Keyword for double-precision floating point data type.

    encapsulation
        Hiding the contents of a class except when absolutely necessary

    ``float``
        Keyword for floating point data type.

    friend
        An operator or function that can access the private data members of a class of which it is designated as a friend.

    friend function
        A function defined outside that class' scope but has access to private and protected members of the class

    function
        A section of code that performs a procedure and is usually named.

    function overloading
        Function overloading is the ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations.

    HAS-A Relationship
        A relationship where one object "belongs to" another object, and behaves according to rules of ownership. 

    hash table
        A collection consisting of key-value pairs with an associated hash function that maps the key to the associated value.

    immutable
        Unable to be modified.
    
    information hiding
        Hiding information so that it is invisible from the outside of an object.

    inheritance
        Sharing/gaining the same behavior as another class

    inheritance hierarchy
        A singly rooted tree structure.

    instance
        An occurrence of an object

    ``int``
        Keyword for integer data type.
    
    ``int main()``
        The main function used to call all other functions.
    
    interface
        A shared boundary in which two or more components of a computer system exchange information.
    
    machine code
        Instructions and data understandable by a computer's CPU.

    mutability
        Able to be modified.
    
    ``NOT``
        An inverter, used to negate input.

    object
        A variable, data structure, function, or a method, that can be referenced by an identifier. 

    object attribute
        A property of an object that describes what it "looks like"

    object-oriented programming language
        Programming language that uses objects to represent data and methods such as C++ and Java

    operator overloading
        Same as function overloading.

    ``OR``
        A basic gate. If either input is true, the output is also. If inputs are false, so is the output.

    overloading
        Specifying more than one definition for the same function name or the same operator within the same scope.

    parameter
        A variable in a function or method definition that accepts data passed from an argument.
    
    pass by reference
        To pass an object to a function by referencing its location in memory.

    pass by value
        To pass an object to a function by copying its value.
    
    programming
        The use of logic to create specified computing operations.

    pointer
        A variable that stores and manipulates memory addresses.

    unordered set
        A container that is not sorted or ordered in any secific way.

    vector
        Sequence container storing data of a single type that is stored in a dynamically allocated array which can change in size.

    ``void``
        Keyword indicating a function has no return value.

    word
        Unit of data used by a particular processor design.
