    :feedback: Review classes and their properties
    :match_1: binary search|||One repeatedly divides a sorted data structure in half and determines if the item is in one half of it until the item is found or deemed not in the data.
    :match_2: chaining|||Collision resolution method, in which each slot in a hash table holds a reference to a collection of items.
    :match_3: collision|||Having two or more items sharing the same slot in a hash table.
    :match_4: collision resolution|||Systematic method for solving hash table collisions.
    :match_5: clustering|||Items being mapped in a hash table near each other resulting in items with collisions being put together.
    :match_6: folding method|||Constructing a hash function by dividing the item into equally sized pieces, adding the pieces together to get a hash value, dividing by the size of the hash table, and the remainder becomes the slot for that item.
    :match_7: hashing|||Creating a value for an input that can be used to find the input by searching for the value.
    :match_8: hash function|||Mapping between an item and its slot in a hash table
    :match_9: linear probing|||Open addressing technique in which each slot is visited one at a time systematically.
    :match_10: load factor|||Its the number of items in a hash table divided by the size of the table.
    :match_11: map|||Associate data type that stores key-data pairs
    :match_12: mid-square method|||Method for constructing a hash function by squaring the item and then using some portion of the result.
    :match_13: open addressing|||Collision resolution that tries to find the next open slot/address in the hash table.
    :match_14: perfect hash function|||Hash function that maps each item to a unique hash slot.
    :match_15: quadratic probing|||Variation of linear probing in which rehashing is done using successive squared values.
    :match_16: rehashing|||Putting an item into a hash table after a collision.
    :match_17: searching|||Algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.
    :match_18: sequential search|||Search method in which one follows the underlying ordering of items in a collection of data to find a specific item.
    :match_19: slot|||Position in a hash table.
