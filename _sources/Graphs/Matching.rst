    :feedback: Look at your glossary
    :match_1: weight|||Shows that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another
    :match_2: vertex|||Also called a “node” this is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a  “key.” This may also have additional information. We will call this additional information the “payload.”
    :match_3: spanning tree|||An acyclic subset of edges that connects all the vertices.
    :match_4: path|||A sequence of vertices that are connected by edges.
    :match_5: parenthesis property|||All the children of a particular node in the depth first tree have a later discovery time and an earlier finish time than their parent.
    :match_6: edge cost|||The weight associated with an arc in a graph.
    :match_7: edge|||An  “arc” connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them and it  may be one-way or two-way.
    :match_8: directed graph|||A graph in which all the edges are one-way.
    :match_9:  adjacency list||| A list implementation where we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to.
    :match_10: breadth first search (BFS)||| A search that proceeds to look through the edges in a graph to find all the vertices in that graph for which there is a path from the starting point.
    :match_11: cycle|||In a directed graph, a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
    :match_12: depth first search (DFS)|||A search type where the goal is to create the deepest tree first, without any branches.
    :match_13: adjacency matrix||| A matrix implementation where each of the rows and columns represent a vertex in the graph, and where if two vertices are connected by an edge, they are considered adjacent.
