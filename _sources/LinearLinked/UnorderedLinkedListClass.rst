The ``Unordered Linked List`` Class
-----------------------------------

As we suggested above, the **unordered linked list**
will be built from a collection of nodes, each linked to the next by explicit
pointers. As long as we know where to find the first node (containing the first
item), each item after that can be found by successively following the
next links. With this in mind, the ``UnorderedList`` class must maintain
a reference to the first node. :ref:`Listing 2 <lst_listclass>` shows the
constructor. Note that each list object will maintain a single reference
to the head of the list.

.. _lst_listclass:

**Listing 2**

.. sourcecode:: cpp

    class UnorderedList {
        public:
            Node *head;

            UnorderedList() {
	           head = NULL;
            }
    }

Initially when we construct a list, there are no items. The assignment and declaration 
statement

::

    UnorderedList myList;

creates the linked list representation shown in
:ref:`Figure 5 <fig_initlinkedlist>`. As we discussed in the ``Node`` class, the
special reference ``NULL`` will again be used to state that the head of
the list does not refer to anything. Eventually, the example list given
earlier will be represented by a linked list as shown in
:ref:`Figure 6 <fig_linkedlist>`. The head of the list points to the first node
which contains the first item of the list. In turn, that node holds a
reference to the next node (the next item) and so on. **It is very important to note that the list class itself does not contain any node**
**objects. Instead it contains a single pointer to only the first node**
**in the linked structure.**

    :correct: b, d

    :feedback_b: Yes, this occurs because the delete keyword is never used to get rid of the list.
    :feedback_c: No, if you lose the head node, your pointer will be pointing at nothing.
    :feedback_d: Right, however, it remains in memory, unknown to you.

    What would happen if you lose the head of a singularly-linked linked list?

The ``isEmpty`` method, shown in :ref:`Listing 3 <lst_isempty>`, simply checks to
see if the head of the list is a reference to ``NULL``. The result of
the boolean expression ``this->head==NULL`` will only be true if there
are no nodes in the linked list. Since a new list is empty, the
constructor and the check for empty must be consistent with one another.
This shows the advantage to using the reference ``NULL`` to denote the
“end” of the linked structure. Two references are equal if they both refer to the same
object. We will use this often in our remaining methods.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _lst_isempty:

**Listing 3**

::

    bool isEmpty() {
        return head == NULL;
    }

So, how do we get items into our linked list? We need to implement the ``add``
method. However, before we can do that, we need to address the important
question of where in the linked list to place the new item. Since this linked
list is unordered, the specific location of the new item with respect to
the other items already in the linked list is not important. The new item can
go anywhere. With that in mind, it makes sense to place the new item in
the easiest location possible.

Recall that the linked list structure provides us with only one entry
point, the head of the linked list. All of the other nodes can only be reached
by accessing the first node and then following ``next`` links. This
means that the easiest place to add the new node is right at the head,
or beginning, of the linked list. In other words, we will make the new item the
first item of the linked list and the existing items will need to be linked to
this new first item so that they follow.

The linked linked list shown in :ref:`Figure 6 <fig_linkedlist>` was built by calling
the ``add`` method a number of times.

::

    >>> mylist.add(31)
    >>> mylist.add(77)
    >>> mylist.add(17)
    >>> mylist.add(93)
    >>> mylist.add(26)
    >>> mylist.add(54)

Note that since 31 is the first item added to the linked list, it will
eventually be the last node on the linked list as every other item is
added ahead of it. Also, since 54 is the last item added, it will become
the data value in the first node of the linked list.

The ``add`` method is shown in :ref:`Listing 4 <lst_add>`. Each item of the linked list
must reside in a node object. Line 2 creates a new node and places the
item as its data. Now we must complete the process by linking the new
node into the existing structure. This requires two steps as shown in
:ref:`Figure 7 <fig_addtohead>`. Step 1 (line 3) changes the ``next`` reference
of the new node to refer to the old first node of the linked list. Now that the
rest of the linked list has been properly attached to the new node, we can
modify the head of the linked list to refer to the new node. The assignment
statement in line 4 sets the head of the linked list.

The order of the two steps described above is very important. What
happens if the order of line 3 and line 4 is reversed? If the
modification of the head of the linked list happens first, the result can be
seen in :ref:`Figure 8 <fig_wrongorder>`. Since the head was the only external
reference to the linked list nodes, all of the original nodes are lost and can
no longer be accessed.

.. _lst_add:

**Listing 4**

::

    void add(int item) {
        Node *temp = new Node(item);
        temp->setNext(head);
        head = temp;
    }

   Figure 8: Result of Reversing the Order of the Two Steps


The next methods that we will implement – ``size``, ``search``, and
``remove`` – are all based on a technique known as **linked list
traversal**. Traversal refers to the process of systematically visiting
each node. To do this we use an external reference that starts at the
first node in the linked list. As we visit each node, we move the reference to
the next node by “traversing” the next reference.

To implement the ``size`` method, we need to traverse the linked list
and keep a count of the number of nodes that occurred.
:ref:`Listing 5 <lst_length>` shows the C++ code for counting the number of
nodes in the linked list. The external reference is called ``current`` and is
initialized to the head of the linked list in line 2. At the start of the
process we have not seen any nodes so the count is set to :math:`0`.
Lines 4–6 actually implement the traversal. As long as the current
reference has not seen the end of the linked list (``NULL``), we move current
along to the next node via the assignment statement in line 6. Again,
the ability to compare a reference to ``NULL`` is very useful. Every
time current moves to a new node, we add :math:`1` to ``count``.
Finally, ``count`` gets returned after the iteration stops.
:ref:`Figure 9 <fig_traversal>` shows this process as it proceeds down the linked list.

.. _lst_length:

**Listing 5**

::

    int size() {
        Node *current = head;
        int count = 0;
        while (current != NULL) {
            count++;
            current = current->getNext();
        }

        return count;
    }



.. _fig_traversal:

.. figure:: Figures/traversal.png
   :align: center

   Figure 9: Traversing the Linked List from the Head to the End


Searching for a value in a linked list implementation of an unordered
linked list also uses the traversal technique. As we visit each node in the
linked list we will ask whether the data stored there matches the item
we are looking for. In this case, however, we may not have to traverse
all the way to the end of the linked list. In fact, if we do get to the end of
the linked list, that means that the item we are looking for must not be
present. Also, if we do find the item, there is no need to continue.

:ref:`Listing 6 <lst_search>` shows the implementation for the ``search`` method.
As in the ``size`` method, the traversal is initialized to start at
the head of the linked list (line 2). As long as there are
more nodes to visit and we have not found the item we are looking for,
we continue to check the next node. The question in line 4 asks whether
the data item is present in the current node. If so, we return ``True``.
When we reach the end of the list and the item has not been found, we return ``False``.

.. _lst_search:

**Listing 6**

::

    bool search(int item) {
        Node *current = head;
        while (current != NULL) {
            if (current->getData() == item) {
                return true;
            } else {
                current = current->getNext();
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

.. mchoice:: travq
    :answer_a: True
    :answer_b: False
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Correct! 
    :feedback_b: Not quite, without the while loop, the traversal could go for as long as the program is allowed to run.

    True / false: The while loop is needed to keep the traversal from going past the end of the list.

As an example, consider invoking the ``search`` method looking for the
item 17.

::

    >>> mylist.search(17)
    1

Since 17 is in the linked list, the traversal process needs to move only to the
node containing 17. At that point, the variable ``found`` is set to
``True`` and the ``while`` condition will fail, leading to the return
value seen above. This process can be seen in :ref:`Figure 10 <fig_searchpic>`.

.. _fig_searchpic:

.. figure:: Figures/search.png
   :align: center

   Figure 10: Successful Search for the Value 17


The ``remove`` method requires two logical steps. First, we need to
traverse the linked list looking for the item we want to remove. Once we find
the item (recall that we assume it is present), we must remove it. The
first step is very similar to ``search``. Starting with an external
reference set to the head of the linked list, we traverse the links until we
discover the item we are looking for. Since we assume that item is
present, we know that the iteration will stop before ``current`` gets to
``NULL``. This means that we can simply use the boolean ``found`` in the
condition.

When ``found`` becomes ``True``, ``current`` will be a reference to the
node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One
possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker
that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this
approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of
items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire
node.

In order to remove the node containing the item, we need to modify the
link in the previous node so that it refers to the node that comes after
``current``. Unfortunately, there is no way to go backward in the linked
list. Since ``current`` refers to the node ahead of the node where we
would like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary
modification.

The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we
traverse down the linked list. ``current`` will behave just as it did
before, marking the current location of the traverse. The new reference,
which we will call ``previous``, will always travel one node behind
``current``. That way, when ``current`` stops at the node to be removed,
``previous`` will be referring to the proper place in the linked list
for the modification.

:ref:`Listing 7 <lst_remove>` shows the complete ``remove`` method. Lines 2–3
assign initial values to the two references. Note that ``current``
starts out at the linked list head as in the other traversal examples.
``previous``, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind
current. For this reason, ``previous`` starts out with a value of
``NULL`` since there is no node before the head (see
:ref:`Figure 11 <fig_removeinit>`). The boolean variable ``found`` will again be
used to control the iteration.

In lines 6–7 we ask whether the item stored in the current node is the
item we wish to remove. If so, ``found`` can be set to ``True``. If we
do not find the item, ``previous`` and ``current`` must both be moved
one node ahead. Again, the order of these two statements is crucial.
``previous`` must first be moved one node ahead to the location of
``current``. At that point, ``current`` can be moved. This process is
often referred to as “inch-worming” as ``previous`` must catch up to
``current`` before ``current`` moves ahead. :ref:`Figure 12 <fig_prevcurr>` shows
the movement of ``previous`` and ``current`` as they progress down the linked
list looking for the node containing the value 17.

.. _lst_remove:

**Listing 7**

::

    void remove(int item) {
        Node *current = head;
        Node *previous = NULL;
        bool found = false;
        while (!found) {
            if (current->getData() == item) {
                found = true;
            } else {
                previous = current;
                current = current->getNext();
            }
        }
        if (previous == NULL) {
            head = current->getNext();
        } else {
            previous->setNext(current->getNext());
        }
    }

   Figure 12: ``previous`` and ``current`` Move Down the Linked List


Once the searching step of the ``remove`` has been completed, we need to
remove the node from the linked list. :ref:`Figure 13 <fig_removepic1>` shows the
link that must be modified. However, there is a special case that needs
to be addressed. If the item to be removed happens to be the first item
in the linked list, then ``current`` will reference the first node in the
linked list. This also means that ``previous`` will be ``NULL``. We said
earlier that ``previous`` would be referring to the node whose next
reference needs to be modified in order to complete the remove. In this
case, it is not ``previous`` but rather the head of the linked list that needs
to be changed (see :ref:`Figure 14 <fig_removehead>`).

   Figure 14: Removing the First Node from the Linked List


Line 12 allows us to check whether we are dealing with the special case
described above. If ``previous`` did not move, it will still have the
value ``NULL`` when the boolean ``found`` becomes ``True``. In that case
(line 13) the head of the linked list is modified to refer to the node after
the current node, in effect removing the first node from the linked
list. However, if previous is not ``NULL``, the node to be removed is
somewhere down the linked list structure. In this case the previous
reference is providing us with the node whose next reference must be
changed. Line 15 uses the ``setNext`` method from ``previous`` to
accomplish the removal. Note that in both cases the destination of the
reference change is ``current.getNext()``. One question that often
arises is whether the two cases shown here will also handle the
situation where the item to be removed is in the last node of the linked
list. We leave that for you to consider.

The remaining methods ``append``, ``insert``, ``index``, and ``pop`` are
left as exercises. Remember that each of these must take into account
whether the change is taking place at the head of the linked list or someplace
else. Also, ``insert``, ``index``, and ``pop`` require that we name the
positions of the linked list. We will assume that position names are integers
starting with 0.

Modify your append method to be :math:`O(1)`  Be Careful!  To really do this correctly you will need to consider a couple of special cases that may require you to make a modification to the add method as well.
