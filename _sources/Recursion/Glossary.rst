.. glossary::

    base case
        A branch of the conditional statement in a recursive function that does
        not give rise to further recursive calls.

    data structure
        An organization of data for the purpose of making it easier to use.

    dynamic programming
        a way to solve complex problems by breaking it up, solving the smaller
        portions, and storing the results to avoid re-calculating them.

    exception
        An error that occurs at runtime.

    handle an exception
        To prevent an exception from terminating a program by wrapping
        the block of code in a ``try`` / ``except`` construct.

    immutable data type
        A data type which cannot be modified.  Assignments to elements or
        slices of immutable types cause a runtime error.

    infinite recursion
        A function that calls itself recursively without ever reaching the base
        case. Eventually, an infinite recursion causes a runtime error.

    mutable data type
        A data type which can be modified. All mutable types are compound
        types.  Lists and dictionaries (see next chapter) are mutable data
        types; strings and tuples are not.

    raise
        To cause an exception by using the ``raise`` statement.

    recursion
        The process of calling the function that is already executing.

    recursive call
        The statement that calls an already executing function.  Recursion can
        even be indirect --- function `f` can call `g` which calls `h`,
        and `h` could make a call back to `f`.

    recursive definition
        A definition which defines something in terms of itself. To be useful
        it must include *base cases* which are not recursive. In this way it
        differs from a *circular definition*.  Recursive definitions often
        provide an elegant way to express complex data structures.

    stack frame
        a stack that contains a "frame" or group of data. For a call stack, this
        would be a function and its arguments.

    tuple
        A data type that contains a sequence of elements of any type, like a
        list, but is immutable. Tuples can be used wherever an immutable type
        is required, such as a key in a dictionary (see next chapter).

    tuple assignment
        An assignment to all of the elements in a tuple using a single
        assignment statement. Tuple assignment occurs in parallel rather than
        in sequence, making it useful for swapping values.
