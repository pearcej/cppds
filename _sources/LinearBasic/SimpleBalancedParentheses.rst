Simple Balanced Parentheses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now turn our attention to using stacks to solve real computer science
problems. You have no doubt written arithmetic expressions such as

:math:`(5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3)`

where parentheses are used to order the performance of operations. You
may also have some experience programming in a language such as Lisp or Scheme
with constructs like:

::

    (defun square(n)
         (* n n))

This defines a function called ``square`` that will return the square of
its argument ``n``. Scheme and Lisp are both notorious for using lots and lots of
parentheses.

In both of these examples, parentheses must appear in a balanced
fashion. **Balanced parentheses** means that each opening symbol has a
corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly
nested. Consider the following correctly balanced strings of
parentheses:

::

    (()()()())

    (((())))

    (()((())()))

Compare those with the following, which are not balanced:

::

    ((((((())

    ()))

    (()()(()

The ability to differentiate between parentheses that are correctly
balanced and those that are unbalanced is an important part of
recognizing many programming language structures.

The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of
parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are
balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important
observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent
opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol (see
:ref:`Figure 4 <fig_parmatch>`). Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to
wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match
opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match
from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the
problem.

   Figure 4: Matching Parentheses

Once you agree that a stack is the appropriate data structure for
keeping the parentheses, the statement of the algorithm is
straightforward. Starting with an empty stack, process the parenthesis
strings from left to right. If a symbol is an opening parenthesis, push
it on the stack as a signal that a corresponding closing symbol needs to
appear later. If, on the other hand, a symbol is a closing parenthesis,
pop the stack. As long as it is possible to pop the stack to match every
closing symbol, the parentheses remain balanced. If at any time there is
no opening symbol on the stack to match a closing symbol, the string is
not balanced properly. At the end of the string, when all symbols have
been processed, the stack should be empty. The C++ and Python code to implement
this algorithm is shown in :ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_parcheck1>`.

This function, ``parChecker``, assumes that a ``Stack`` class is
available and returns a Boolean result as to whether the string of
parentheses is balanced. Note that the Boolean variable ``balanced`` is
initialized to `true`` as there is no reason to assume otherwise at the
start. If the current symbol is ``(``, then it is pushed on the stack
(lines 15-16). Note also in line 22 that ``pop`` simply removes a symbol
from the stack, and returns nothing. At the end (lines 28-31), as long as the
expression is balanced and the stack has been completely cleaned off,
the string represents a correctly balanced sequence of parentheses.
