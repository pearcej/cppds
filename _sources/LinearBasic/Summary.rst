Summary
-------

-  Linear data structures maintain their data in an ordered fashion.

-  Stacks are simple data structures that maintain a LIFO, last-in
   first-out, ordering.

-  The fundamental operations for a stack are ``push``, ``pop``, and
   ``empty``.

-  Queues are simple data structures that maintain a FIFO, first-in
   first-out, ordering.

-  The fundamental operations for a queue are ``push``, ``pop``,
   and ``empty``.

-  Prefix, infix, and postfix are all ways to write expressions.

-  Stacks are very useful for designing algorithms to evaluate and
   translate expressions.

-  Stacks can provide a reversal characteristic.

-  Queues can assist in the construction of timing simulations.

-  Simulations use random number generators to create a real-life
   situation and allow us to answer “what if” types of questions.

-  Deques are data structures that allow hybrid behavior like that of
   stacks and queues.

-  The fundamental operations for a deque are ``push_front``, ``push_back``, 
   ``pop_front``, ``pop_back``, and ``empty``.
