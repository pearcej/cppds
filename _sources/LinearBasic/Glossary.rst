    algorithm
        a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem

        
    balanced parentheses
        each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested

    deque
        an ordered collection of items with two ends and the items remain positioned in the collection. New items can be added at either the front or the rear

    first-in first-out (FIFO)
        ordering principle in which the first item added is also the first removed

    fully parenthesized
        the usage of one pair of parentheses for each operator

    infix
        expression notation in which the operator is in between the two operands that it is working on

    last-in first-out (LIFO)
        ordering principle in which the last item added is also the first removed

    linear data structure
        a data structure with elements that have positions relative to each other

    palindrome
        a string that reads the same forward and backward

    postfix
        expression notation in which all operators come after the two operands that they work on

    precedence
        hierarchy on the order things occur

    prefix
        expression notation in which all operators precede the two operands that they work on

    queue
         an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end

    simulation
          an imitation of a process or operations

    stack
        an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end
