    :feedback: Review classes and their properties
    :match_1: bubble sort|||Makes multiple passes through a collection, comparing adjacent items, and swaps items that are out of order
    :match_2: gap|||Used to divide a collection into subsets without breaking apart the collection during a shell sort
    :match_3: insertion sort|||Maintains a sorted and unsorted subset of a collection and inserts elements from the unsorted subset into the sorted subset
    :match_4: median of three|||Method of choosing the pivot value for a quick sort by taking the median of the first, middle, and last element of a collection
    :match_5: merge|||Takes two smaller sorted subsets and combines them
    :match_6: merge sort|||Uses recursion to split a collection in half until there is one item and then combines the smaller subsets back into larger sorted subsets
    :match_7: partition|||Finds the split point and moves items to the appropriate side of the collection, either less than or greater than the pivot value 
    :match_8: pivot value|||Value selected in a collection during quick sort in order to split a collection
    :match_9: selection sort|||Makes multiple passes through a collection, taking the largest or lowest unsorted element and places it into its correct place by swapping places with the next largest or lowest element
    :match_10: short bubble|||Stops if there are no exchanges to do
    :match_11: shell sort|||Divides the collection into subsets, sorts the subsets individually using insertion sort, then also sorts the combination of the sorted subsets using insertion sort
    :match_12: sorting|||Process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order
    :match_13: split point|||Position of the pivot value in the sorted collection; used to divide the collection for subsequent calls to quick sort
    :match_14: quick sort|||Uses recursion to split a collection in half and places elements on the proper side of the split point
