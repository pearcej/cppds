    bubble sort
        sorting method that makes multiple passes through a collection, comparing
        adjacent items, and swaps items that are out of order

    gap
        an increment used to divide a collection into subsets without breaking
        apart the collection during a shell sort

    insertion sort
        sorting method that maintains a sorted and unsorted subset of a
        collection and inserts elements from the unsorted subset into the sorted
        subset

    median of three
        method of choosing the pivot value for a quick sort by taking the median
        of the first, middle, and last element of a collection

    merge
        part of merge sort that takes two smaller sorted subsets and combines
        them

    merge sort
        sorting method that uses recursion to split a collection in half until
        there is one item and then combines the smaller subsets back into larger
        sorted subsets

    partition
        process of quick sort that that finds the split point and moves items to
        the appropriate side of the collection, either less than or greater than
        the pivot value

    pivot value
        value selected in a collection during quick sort in order to split a
        collection

    selection sort
        sorting method that makes multiple passes through a collection, taking
        the largest (ascending) or smallest (descending) unsorted element and
        places it into its correct place by swapping places with the next largest
        or lowest element

    shell sort
        sorting method that divides the collection into subsets, sorts the subsets
        individually using insertion sort, then also sorts the combination of the
        sorted subsets using insertion sort

    short bubble
        a modified bubble sort that stops if there are no exchanges to do

    sorting
        the process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order

    split point
        the position of the pivot value in the sorted collection; used to divide
        the collection for subsequent calls to quick sort

    quick sort
        sorting method that uses recursion to split a collection in half (without
        using extra space) and places elements on the proper side of the split
        point
