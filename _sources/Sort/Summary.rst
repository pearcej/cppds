Summary
-------

-  A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are
   :math:`O(n^{2})` algorithms.

-  A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental
   sublists. It falls between :math:`O(n)` and :math:`O(n^{2})`.

-  A merge sort is :math:`O(n \log n)`, but requires additional space
   for the merging process.

-  A quick sort is :math:`O(n \log n)`, but may degrade to
   :math:`O(n^{2})` if the split points are not near the middle of the
   list. It does not require additional space.
