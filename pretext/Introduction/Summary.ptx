                <p>Computer science is the study of problem solving.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both
                    processes and data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a
                    problem domain by hiding the details of the data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>C++ is a powerful object-oriented language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All variables must be declared before use in C++.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>C++ has typical built-in numeric types: <c>int</c> is for integers and <c>float</c> and <c>double</c> are used for floating point depending on the number of digits desired.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>C++ has the Boolean type <c>bool</c> that holds <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The character data type <c>char</c> holds a single character which is encased in single quotes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pointers are a type of variable that stores a memory address. To declare a pointer, an  <c>*</c> is used before the variable name that is supposed to store the location.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A statically allocated C++ array is an ordered collection of one or more C++ data values of identical type stored in contiguous memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A vector is a dynamically allocated array with many useful methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>C++ strings are a sequential collection of zero or more characters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A hash table is used to store keys-value pairs. It applies a related hash function to the key in order to compute the location of the associated value. Look-up is typically very fast.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A set is an unordered collection of unique values.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Arrays, vectors, and strings are C++ sequential collections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hash tables and sets are nonsequential collections of data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In C++, a function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, a return type, and a body.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Non-fruitful functions in C++ must contain the keyword <c>void</c> in its function definition.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can pass variables by value as well as by reference in C++ functions. Passing by reference utilizes the use of pointers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pass by reference is useful when you require a function to return multiple variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To pass an array to a function you need to use an array parameter. The array parameter is denoted by the array variable name followed by set of square brackets ([ and ]).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Defining a new meaning for an already existing operator (such as the arithmetic operators plus <q>+</q> or times <q>*</q>) is called overloading the operator. The operators ::, #, ., and ? are reserved and cannot be overloaded.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Some operators such as =, [], () and -&gt; can only be overloaded as member functions of a class and not as global functions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new
                    methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Classes can be organized into hierarchies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A class constructor should always invoke the constructor of its
                    parent before continuing on with its own data and behavior.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
