        <title>Reviewing Basic C++</title>
        <p>In this section, we will review the programming language C++ and also
            provide some more detailed examples of the ideas from the previous
            section. If you are new to C++ or find that you need more information
            about any of the topics presented, we recommend that you consult a resource such as
            the <url href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/" visual="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/">C++ Reference</url>
            or a <url href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" visual="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">C++ Tutorial</url>.
            Our goal
            here is to reacquaint you with the C++ language and also reinforce some of
            the concepts that will be central to later chapters.</p>
        <p><idx>compiler</idx><idx>machine mode</idx>C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
            It has a powerful set of built-in data types and control
            constructs. Since C++ is a compiled language, all the code written in this language,
            when run, are translated to <term>machine code</term> by a program called the <term>compiler</term>.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of C++ code that writes to the console:</p>

    <program xml:id="cpp" interactive="activecode" language="cpp">
        <input>
//Outputs strings to command line.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Welcome to Problem Solving with" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Algorithms and Data Structures!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return  0;
}
        </input>
    </program>
