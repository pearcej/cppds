        <title>Getting Started with Data</title>
        <p>C++ considers data to be the focal point of the problem-solving process.
            We stated above that C++ supports the object-oriented programming
            paradigm. In C++, as well as in any other
            object-oriented programming language, we define a <term>class</term> to be a
            description of what the data looks like (the state) and what the data can
            do (the behavior). Classes are analogous to abstract data types because
            a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of a data item.
            Data items are called <term>objects</term> in the object-oriented paradigm. An object
            is an instance of a class.</p>
