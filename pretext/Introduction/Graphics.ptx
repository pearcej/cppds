        <title><term>Optional</term>: Graphics in C++</title>
        <introduction>
        <p>C++ is designed with the principal that speed is more important than safety and error-checking.
            This differs from the majority of other programming languages, which tend to be considerably more
            restrictive in regards to aspects such as memory allocations and resource management.
            C++ is translated to <q>machine language</q> when it is compiled, which is a step skipped by other languages.</p>
        <p>This difference is what allows C++ to be as fast as it is, which also makes it particularly good
            for graphically-intensive applications. Graphical applications heavily leverage memory management
            to display every pixel you see on your screen. Many languages do not allow for the creation of arrays like in
            C++, which are just <q>chunks</q> of memory of a fixed size. Furthermore, running directly on the hardware
            allows C++ to communicate better with other components of your computer, such as your graphics processing unit, or <q>GPU</q>.
            This is one of many reasons C++ is considered an industry standard for high-performance graphics applications, such as
            video games or software used for visual effects in movies.</p>
        <p>Turtle graphics are a popular and simple way for introducing programming to beginners.
            It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by
            Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon in 1967.</p>
        <p>Imagine Turtles as being a digital marker used for drawing various shapes, images, and designs.
            Drawing with Turtles can be as basic as a simple triangle and as complex as a highly detailed fractal image.
            Nearly all commands used when drawing with Turtles are as simple as telling your Turtle to move forward, backward,
            left, and right in as few or many steps as desired.</p>

            <p>Visual representations afford students an opportunity to observe a facet of computer science
                from an alternative point of view: rather than waiting anxiously for the print statement
                to come around after your program churns, you get a visual representation of the concept itself.
                This is particularly useful for abstract concepts such as recursion and iteration.</p>
            <p>For C++, a library titled C-Turtle is used to provide an equivalent of Python's Turtles.
                It acts as a close replacement to provide easy to use graphics to C++, while maintaining
                the objects and commands present in Python. It was developed by Jesse Walker-Schadler
                at Berea College during the summer of 2019 and can be found on GitHub here: <url href="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle/" visual="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle/">https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle/</url></p>
            <p><xref ref="expl-cturtle_1"/> is a comparison of two versions, C++ and Python, which should do
                the same thing. Try running both and comparing how the code looks between the two versions.</p>

            <p>Turtles must exist on a <c>TurtleScreen</c> to be used. The <c>TurtleScreen</c> object must
                be created before you can create a <c>Turtle</c> object for this reason.</p>

            <p>Closing a <c>TurtleScreen</c> when you're done with it is fairly simple to do. For this chapter,
                only the method <c>bye</c> is used. Calling it is not completely necessary, as it is also called
                automatically if it, or an equivalent method, hasn't been called. When working outside of the
                textbook, the <c>exitonclick</c> method is also available.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-2"><code>
screen.bye();

            <p>Turtles are based on the following premise: <q>There is a turtle on a canvas with a colored pen
                attached to their tail.</q> In this case, the <em>canvas</em> is a <c>TurtleScreen</c>. This Turtle will
                follow any command you give it, which consist of telling it to go certain directions, what color
                of pen to use, when to raise or lower its pen, and others. <xref ref="tab-turtlefun"/> has an outline of commonly used
                methods when working with turtles.</p>

            <p>The order of operations given to a turtle is important, as some actions must be completed
                one after another. A good example of this is the <c>begin_fill</c> and <c>end_fill</c>
                pattern, which must be called in that specified order to actually fill a shape.</p>

            <p>Every basic shape in CTurtle is a set of coordinates. Within the CTurtle library we have the
                choice of a select few shapes that we can me our Turtles inhabit.
                To change the appearance of your Turtle, you can use <c>shape</c> to set your Turtle to
                one of four default shapes, or a custom shape. CTurtle features four default shapes, <c>triangle</c>,
                <c>indented_triangle</c>, <c>square</c>, and <c>arrow</c>.</p>
            <p>The following code example shows how to set the shape of a turtle by giving it the name of a shape.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-3"><code>
turtle.shape(&quot;square&quot;);
</code></program>
            <p>Given that all primitive shapes are defined as a collection of points, all of the default shapes are also defined this way
                <xref ref="turtle-shapes"/>.
                Polygons, for custom and default shapes, must have their points defined in counter-clockwise order to appear correctly.
                This is due to the mathematics behind filling arbitrary shapes, and is a limitation almost all computer graphics need to
                abide by. Consider the order of their points in the following table, and how they could be considered <q>counter-clockwise</q>.
                They are in order from top to bottom, and one edge exists between the first last points for each of these shapes. Please note
                that positive Y coordinates are <em>lower</em> on the screen, while negative Y coordinates are <em>higher</em> on the screen. Coordinates at
                the origin<ndash/> that is, coordinate 0x, 0y<ndash/> is at the <q>point</q> or <q>tip</q> of the turtle. This is why most of the default shapes
                have their first coordinate there.</p>

            <p>The example code below illustrates how to create your own shape. We use the <c>Polygon</c> class to represent our shape.
                For this example, we take the <c>triangle</c> default shape and make every Y coordinate negative to make it appear upside-down.</p>

ct::Polygon upside_down_triangle = {
  {0, 0},   //First point
  {-5, -5}, //Second point
  {5, -5}  //and so on.
};

            <p>The following code is a full example for setting your turtle to a custom shape. Feel free to mess around with
                the coordinates of the polygon, you might surprise yourself with what shape you end up with!</p>

            <p>Stamps provide a way to make several copies of the shape of the turtle across the screen without having to trace each
                shape individually with the turtle. This can be used for a variety of visual effects, however it is often used as a
                time-saving utility. Stamps can be placed with the <c>stamp</c> method of Turtle objects, which returns an integer
                that acts as the <term>ID</term> of the stamp that has been placed. The <c>clearstamp</c> method of the Turtle object can
                be used to delete a single stamp from the screen, while the <c>clearstamps</c> method is used to delete multiple

            <p>Regarding angles, Turtles can use both <em>degrees</em> and <em>radians</em> for their rotations. You can choose between the two using the
                <c>radians</c> and <c>degrees</c> methods for the Turtle object. By default, all angles are measured in <em>degrees</em>. This option
                only effects methods regarding rotation, such as <c>left</c> and <c>right</c>.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-5"><code>
turtle.degrees();
turtle.right(90);//90-degree turn to the right
turtle.radians();
turtle.left(1.5708f);//Equivalent rotation in radians to the left.
</code></program>
            <p>The <c>tracer(N)</c> method is used to control how many times the Turtle is actually
                drawn on the screen. This method belongs to the <c>TurtleScreen</c> object, and effects
                all turtles that are on the screen. The <c>N</c> in the method represents the input,
                only allowing the <c>TurtleScreen</c> to display one frame out every <c>N</c>.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-6"><code>
screen.tracer(12);
//Show one out of every 12 frames of animation.
</code></program>
            <p>This can be combined with the <c>speed</c> method available to turtles to achieve <term>very</term> quickly
                drawn images. The maximum speed a Turtle can have, <c>TS_FASTEST</c>, completely disables animation
                for Turtles between movements and rotations. This allows the <c>tracer</c> setting to directly relate
                to the total number of actions the turtle makes. The actions the turtle takes happen regardless
                of whether or not they are actually shown on the screen.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-7"><code>
screen.tracer(3); //Show one out of every 3 frames of animation.
turtle.speed(ct::TS_FASTEST);  //Disables Turtle animation

turtle.forward(50);//This is not shown on-screen...
turtle.right(90);//Neither is this...
turtle.forward(50);//But this action is, because it is third out of three.
</code></program>
            <p>A frame of animation is added for almost every action a turtle takes, regardless of whether or not
                the turtle is moving or adding something to the screen. This includes methods like
                <c>begin_fill</c> and <c>end_fill</c>, which don't do anything visually but do
                tell the turtle to start or stop tracking its own movements.</p>
            <p>Consider the following example and related questions.</p>
            <program language="cpp" label="Graphics-prog-8"><code>
#include &lt;CTurtle.hpp&gt;
namespace ct = cturtle;

int main(){
    ct::TurtleScreen screen;
    ct::Turtle turtle(screen);

    turtle.speed(ct::TS_FASTEST);
    screen.tracer(6);

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
        turtle.right(60);
        turtle.forward(50);
    }

    screen.bye();

    return 0;
}
</code></program>

    
            <p>Similarly to tracer settings, every action a turtle takes is also added to the <em>undo queue</em>. This allows it to keep track
                of actions it is performing over a period of time. The queue is only allowed to grow to a certain size, starting at 100 actions total.
                This is modifiable through the <c>setundobuffer</c> method that belongs to turtles. Every action is added, even if
                the action doesn't change anything visually. This feature is comparable to the <q>undo</q> tool available in most text editors.
                Turtles can <q>undo</q> their progress with the <c>undo</c> method.</p>
