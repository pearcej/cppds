            <li>
                <p>Modify the infix-to-postfix algorithm so that it can handle errors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Modify the postfix evaluation algorithm so that it can handle errors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implement a direct infix evaluator that combines the functionality of
                    infix-to-postfix conversion and the postfix evaluation algorithm.
                    Your evaluator should process infix tokens from left to right and use
                    two stacks, one for operators and one for operands, to perform the
                    evaluation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Turn your direct infix evaluator from the previous problem into a
                    calculator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implement the <c>Queue</c> ADT, using a vector such that the rear of the
                    queue is at the end of the vector.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Design and implement an experiment to do benchmark comparisons of the
                    two queue implementations. What can you learn from such an
                    experiment?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is possible to implement a queue such that both enqueue and
                    dequeue have <m>O(1)</m> performance <em>on average</em>. In this case it
                    means that most of the time enqueue and dequeue will be
                    <m>O(1)</m> except in one particular circumstance where dequeue
                    will be <m>O(n)</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Consider a real life situation. Formulate a question and then design
                    a simulation that can help to answer it. Possible situations include:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Cars lined up at a car wash</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Customers at a grocery store check-out</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Airplanes taking off and landing on a runway</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A bank teller</p>
                    </li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Be sure to state any assumptions that you make and provide any
                    probabilistic data that must be considered as part of the scenario.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Modify the Hot Potato simulation to allow for a randomly chosen
                    counting value so that each pass is not predictable from the previous
                    one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implement a radix sorting machine. A radix sort for base 10 integers
                    is a mechanical sorting technique that utilizes a collection of bins,
                    one main bin and 10 digit bins. Each bin acts like a queue and
                    maintains its values in the order that they arrive. The algorithm
                    begins by placing each number in the main bin. Then it considers each
                    value digit by digit. The first value is removed and placed in a
                    digit bin corresponding to the digit being considered. For example,
                    if the ones digit is being considered, 534 is placed in digit bin 4
                    and 667 is placed in digit bin 7. Once all the values are placed in
                    the corresponding digit bins, the values are collected from bin 0 to
                    bin 9 and placed back in the main bin. The process continues with the
                    tens digit, the hundreds, and so on. After the last digit is
                    processed, the main bin contains the values in order.</p>

                <p>Another example of the parentheses matching problem comes from
                    hypertext markup language (HTML). In HTML, tags exist in both opening
                    and closing forms and must be balanced to properly describe a web
                    document. This very simple HTML document:</p>
                <pre>&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;
         Example
      &lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;

   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
                <p>is intended only to show the matching and nesting structure for tags
                    in the language. Write a program that can check an HTML document for
                    proper opening and closing tags.</p>

                <p>Extend the program from Listing 2.15 to handle palindromes with
                    spaces. For example, I PREFER PI is a palindrome that reads the same
                    forward and backward if you ignore the blank characters.</p>
