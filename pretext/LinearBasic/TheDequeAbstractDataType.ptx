        <title>The Deque Abstract Data Type</title>
        <p>The deque abstract data type is defined by the following structure and
            operations. A deque is structured, as described above, as an ordered
            collection of items where items are added and removed from either end,
            either front or rear. The deque operations are given below.</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>deque&lt;dataType&gt; dequeName</c> creates a new deque that is empty. It returns an empty deque.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>push_front(item)</c> adds a new item to the front of the deque. It
                    needs the item and returns nothing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>push_back(item)</c> adds a new item to the rear of the deque. It needs
                    the item and returns nothing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>pop_front()</c> removes the front item from the deque. It needs no
                    parameters. The deque is modified.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>pop_back()</c> removes the rear item from the deque. It needs no
                    parameters. The deque is modified.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>empty()</c> tests to see whether the deque is empty. It needs no
                    parameters and returns a boolean value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>size()</c> returns the number of items in the deque. It needs no
                    parameters and returns an integer.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>As an example, if we assume that <c>d</c> is a deque that has been created
            and is currently empty, then <xref ref="linear-basic_tbl-dequeoperations"/> shows the results
            of a sequence of deque operations. Note that the contents in front are
            listed on the right. It is very important to keep track of the front and
            the rear as you move items in and out of the collection as things can
            get a bit confusing.</p>
