        <title>What is a Stack?</title>
        <p>
            <idx>stack</idx>
            A <term>stack</term> (sometimes called a <q>push-down stack</q>) is an ordered
            collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of
            existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly
            referred to as the <q>top.</q> The end opposite the top is known as the
            <q>base.</q></p>
        <p>The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack
            that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack
            the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position
            to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called
            <idx>LIFO</idx><idx>last-in first-out</idx>
            <term>LIFO</term>, <term>last-in first-out</term>. It provides an ordering based on length
            of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older
            items are near the base.</p>
        <p>Many examples of stacks occur in everyday situations. Almost any
            cafeteria has a stack of trays or plates where you take the one at the
            top, uncovering a new tray or plate for the next customer in line.
            Imagine a stack of books on a desk (<xref ref="fig-bookstack"/>). The only
            book whose cover is visible is the one on top. To access others in the
            stack, we need to remove the ones that are sitting on top of them.
            <xref ref="fig-objectstack"/> shows another stack.</p>

                        The image shows a stack of books stacked on top of each other on a table. The books have different colors and thicknesses, and their titles are visible: Python, Calculus, Physics, Music, and History.

                        The image shows a diagram of a stack, with the top element labeled "true" and the bottom element labeled "dog". The stack is visually represented as a vertical column of boxes, with arrows indicating the direction of addition and removal of elements.

        <p>One of the most useful ideas related to stacks comes from the simple
            observation of items as they are added and then removed. Assume you
            start out with a clean desktop. Now place books one at a time on top of
            each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you
            begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the
            reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally
            important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order
            of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.
            <xref ref="fig-reversal"/> shows the stack object as it was
            created and then again as items are removed. Note the order of the
            objects.</p>

                        The image depicts a diagram of a stack, visually demonstrating the original order of elements and the reversed order after they are popped out. It highlights the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle of stacks, where elements are removed in the opposite order they were added.

<exercise label="stack_prob" indent="show" language="python"><statement>
        <p>Say we create a stack by pushing numbers 1 to 4 from lowest to highest. What would the stack look like afterwards?</p>
</statement>
<blocks><block order="1">
<cline>4</cline>
<cline>3</cline>
<cline>2</cline>
<cline>1</cline>
</block></blocks></exercise>        <p>Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of
            stacks that occur as you use your computer. For example, every web
            browser has a Back button. As you navigate from web page to web page,
            those pages are placed on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are
            going on the stack). The current page that you are viewing is on the top
            and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the
            Back button, you begin to move in reverse order through the pages.</p>
