        <title>Simulation: Hot Potato</title>
        <p>One of the typical applications for showing a queue in action is to
            simulate a real situation that requires data to be managed in a FIFO
            manner. To begin, let's consider the children's game Hot Potato. In this
            game (see <xref ref="fig-quhotpotato"/>) children line up in a circle and
            pass an item from neighbor to neighbor as fast as they can. At a certain
            point in the game, the action is stopped and the child who has the item
            (the potato) is removed from the circle. Play continues until only one
            child is left.</p>

                        The image illustrates a simulation of the children's game &quot;Hot Potato&quot; using a queue. 
                        Six participants—Bill, David, Susan, Jane, Kent, and Brad—are arranged in a circular pattern. 
                        An item (the &quot;potato&quot;) is passed from one person to the next in clockwise order. 
                        After a predefined number of passes (five in this case), Brad, who is holding the potato, is eliminated and removed from the circle. 
                        The process repeats until only one participant remains. Arrows indicate the direction of the potato being passed between participants.

        <p>This game is a modern-day equivalent of the famous Josephus problem.
            Based on a legend about the famous first-century historian Flavius
            Josephus, the story is told that in the Jewish revolt against Rome,
            Josephus and 39 of his comrades held out against the Romans in a cave.
            With defeat imminent, they decided that they would rather die than be
            slaves to the Romans. They arranged themselves in a circle. One man was
            designated as number one, and proceeding clockwise they killed every
            seventh man. Josephus, according to the legend, was among other things
            an accomplished mathematician. He instantly figured out where he ought
            to sit in order to be the last to go. When the time came, instead of
            killing himself, he joined the Roman side. You can find many different
            versions of this story. Some count every third man and some allow the
            last man to escape on a horse. In any case, the idea is the same.</p>
        <p>We will implement a general <term>simulation</term> of Hot Potato. Our program
            will input an array of names and a constant, call it <q>num,</q> to be used for
            counting. It will return the name of the last person remaining after
            repetitive counting by <c>num</c>. What happens at that point is up to you.</p>
        <p>To simulate the circle, we will use a queue (see
            <xref ref="fig-qupotatoqueue"/>). Assume that the child holding the potato will
            be at the front of the queue. Upon passing the potato, the simulation
            will simply dequeue and then immediately enqueue that child, putting her
            at the end of the line. She will then wait until all the others have
            been at the front before it will be her turn again. After <c>num</c>
            dequeue/enqueue operations, the child at the front will be removed
            permanently and another cycle will begin. This process will continue
            until only one name remains (the size of the queue is 1).</p>

                        The image illustrates a queue implementation of the &quot;Hot Potato&quot; game. 
                        The top diagram shows the queue in its initial state, with participants Brad, Kent, Jane, Susan, David, and Bill arranged from rear to front. 
                        Arrows indicate the process of dequeueing the person at the front (Bill) and enqueuing them at the rear to simulate the potato being passed. 
                        The bottom diagram shows the updated queue after one cycle of passing, where the order now starts with Brad at the rear and ends with David at the front. 
                        The diagrams visually represent the enqueue and dequeue operations in the queue-based simulation of the game.

        <p>The program is shown in <xref ref="lst-josephussim-cpp"/>. A call to the
            <c>hotPotato</c> function using 7 as the counting constant returns <c>Susan</c>.</p>

        <p>Note that in this example the value of the counting constant is greater
            than the number of names in the array. This is not a problem since the
            queue acts like a circle and counting continues back at the beginning
            until the value is reached. Also, notice that the array is loaded into
            the queue such that the first name on the array will be at the front of
            the queue. <c>Bill</c> in this case is the first item in the array and
            therefore moves to the front of the queue. A variation of this
            implementation, described in the exercises, allows for a random counter.</p>
