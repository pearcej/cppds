        <title>What Is a Queue?</title>
        <p>
        <idx>queue</idx>
        A <term>queue</term> is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new
            items happens at one end, called the <q>rear,</q> and the removal of existing
            items occurs at the other end, commonly called the <q>front.</q> As an
            element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward
            the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be
            removed.</p>
        <p><idx>FIFO</idx>The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the
            collection. The item that has been in the collection the longest is at
            the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called <term>FIFO</term>,
            <term>first-in first-out</term>. It is also known as <q>first-come first-served.</q></p>
        <p>The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all
            participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait
            in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria
            line (so that we can pop the tray stack). Well-behaved lines, or queues,
            are very restrictive in that they have only one way in and only one way
            out. There is no jumping in the middle and no leaving before you have
            waited the necessary amount of time to get to the front.

                    The image shows a simple queue of Python data objects. The queue is represented as a horizontal line with items ordered from rear to front. 
                    The items in the queue are &quot;8.4&quot;, &quot;True&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, and &quot;4&quot;, listed in sequence. 
                    Arrows indicate the flow of the queue, where new items are added at the rear (left) and items are removed from the front (right). 
                    This visually represents the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior of a queue.

        <p>Computer science also has common examples of queues. Our computer
            laboratory has 30 computers networked with a single printer. When
            students want to print, their print tasks <q>get in line</q> with all the
            other printing tasks that are waiting. The first task in is the next to
            be completed. If you are last in line, you must wait for all the other
            tasks to print ahead of you. We will explore this interesting example in
            more detail later.</p>
        <p>In addition to printing queues, operating systems use a number of
            different queues to control processes within a computer. The scheduling
            of what gets done next is typically based on a queuing algorithm that
            tries to execute programs as quickly as possible and serve as many users
            as it can. Also, as we type, sometimes keystrokes get ahead of the
            characters that appear on the screen. This is due to the computer doing
            other work at that moment. The keystrokes are being placed in a
            queue-like buffer so that they can eventually be displayed on the screen
            in the proper order.</p>
