        <title>What Are Linear Structures?</title>
        <p><idx>linear data structures</idx>We will begin our study of data structures by
            considering four simple but very powerful concepts. Vectors, stacks, queues,
            deques are examples of data collections whose items are
            ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is
            added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that
            came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often
            referred to as <term>linear data structures</term>.</p>
        <p>Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these
            ends are referred to as the <q>left</q> and the <q>right</q> or in some cases the
            <q>front</q> and the <q>rear.</q> You could also call them the <q>top</q> and the
            <q>bottom.</q> The names given to the ends are not significant. What
            distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which
            items are added and removed, in particular the location where these
            additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new
            items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to
            be removed from either end.</p>
        <p>These variations give rise to some of the most useful data structures in
            computer science. They appear in many algorithms and can be used to
            solve a variety of important problems.</p>
