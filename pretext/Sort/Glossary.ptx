                        <p>sorting method that makes multiple passes through a collection, comparing
                            adjacent items, and swaps items that are out of order</p>

                        <p>sorting method that maintains a sorted and unsorted subset of a
                            collection and inserts elements from the unsorted subset into the sorted

                        <p>part of merge sort that takes two smaller sorted subsets and combines

                        <p>sorting method that uses recursion to split a collection in half until
                            there is one item and then combines the smaller subsets back into larger
                            sorted subsets</p>

                        <p>process of quick sort that that finds the split point and moves items to
                            the appropriate side of the collection, either less than or greater than
                            the pivot value</p>

                        <p>sorting method that makes multiple passes through a collection, taking
                            the largest (ascending) or smallest (descending) unsorted element and
                            places it into its correct place by swapping places with the next largest
                            or lowest element</p>

                        <p>sorting method that divides the collection into subsets, sorts the subsets
                            individually using insertion sort, then also sorts the combination of the
                            sorted subsets using insertion sort</p>

                            using extra space) and places elements on the proper side of the split
