                <p>A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are
                    <m>O(n^{2})</m> algorithms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental
                    sublists. It falls between <m>O(n)</m> and <m>O(n^{2})</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A merge sort is <m>O(n \log n)</m>, but requires additional space
                    for the merging process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A quick sort is <m>O(n \log n)</m>, but may degrade to
                    <m>O(n^{2})</m> if the split points are not near the middle of the
                    list. It does not require additional space.</p>
