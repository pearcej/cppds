        <p>With the implementation of our tree data structure
            complete, we now look at an example of how a tree can be used to solve
            some real problems. In this section we will look at parse trees. Parse
            trees can be used to represent real-world constructions like sentences or mathematical expressions.</p>

It has two child nodes: on the left, a plus sign '+' connects the numbers 7 and 3, and on the right, a minus sign '-' connects the numbers 5 and 2. This tree represents the mathematical expression ((7 + 3) * (5 - 2)). The image is labeled 'Figure 2: Parse Tree for ((7 + 3) * (5 - 2)).</p></description>
                </image>
            </figure>

        <p>We can also represent a mathematical expression such as
            <m>((7 + 3) * (5 - 2))</m> as a parse tree, as shown in
            <xref ref="fig-meparse"/>. We have already looked at fully parenthesized
            expressions, so what do we know about this expression? We know that
            multiplication has a higher precedence than either addition or
            subtraction. Because of the parentheses, we know that before we can do
            the multiplication we must evaluate the parenthesized addition and
            subtraction expressions. The hierarchy of the tree helps us understand
            the order of evaluation for the whole expression. Before we can evaluate
            the top-level multiplication, we must evaluate the addition and the
            subtraction in the subtrees. The addition, which is the left subtree,
            evaluates to 10. The subtraction, which is the right subtree, evaluates
            to 3. Using the hierarchical structure of trees, we can simply replace
            an entire subtree with one node once we have evaluated the expressions
            in the children. Applying this replacement procedure gives us the
            simplified tree shown in <xref ref="fig-mesimple"/>.</p>

        <p>In the rest of this section we are going to examine parse trees in more
            detail. In particular we will look at</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>How to build a parse tree from a fully parenthesized mathematical
                    expression.</p>
            </li>

                <p>How to evaluate the expression stored in a parse tree.</p>

            <li>
                <p>How to recover the original mathematical expression from a parse
                    tree.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The first step in building a parse tree is to break up the expression
            string into a vector of tokens. There are four different kinds of tokens
            to consider: left parentheses, right parentheses, operators, and
            operands. We know that whenever we read a left parenthesis we are
            starting a new expression, and hence we should create a new tree to
            correspond to that expression. Conversely, whenever we read a right
            parenthesis, we have finished an expression. We also know that operands
            are going to be leaf nodes and children of their operators. Finally, we
            know that every operator is going to have both a left and a right child.</p>
        <p>Using the information from above we can define four rules as follows:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>If the current token is a <c>'('</c>, add a new node as the left child
                    of the current node, and descend to the left child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the current token is in the vector <c>['+','-','/','*']</c>, set the
                    root value of the current node to the operator represented by the
                    current token. Add a new node as the right child of the current node
                    and descend to the right child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the current token is a number, set the root value of the current
                    node to the number and return to the parent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the current token is a <c>')'</c>, go to the parent of the current
                    node.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Before writing the C++ code, let's look at an example of the rules
            outlined above in action. We will use the expression
            <m>(3 + (4 * 5))</m>. We will parse this expression into the
            following vector of character tokens <c>['(', '3', '+',</c>
            <c>'(', '4', '*', '5' ,')',')']</c>. Initially we will start out with a
            parse tree that consists of an empty root node. <xref ref="parse_fig-bldexpstep"/>
            illustrates the structure and contents of the parse tree, as each new
            token is processed.</p>

        <p>Using <xref ref="parse_fig-bldexpstep"/>, let's walk through the example step by
            step:</p>
        <p><ol marker="a">
            <li>
                <p>Create an empty tree.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>(</c> as the first token. By rule<nbsp/>1, create a new node as the left
                    child of the root. Make the current node this new child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>3</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>3, set the root value of the
                    current node to <c>3</c> and go back up the tree to the parent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>+</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>2, set the root value of the
                    current node to <c>+</c> and add a new node as the right child. The new
                    right child becomes the current node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>(</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>1, create a new node as the left
                    child of the current node. The new left child becomes the current
                    node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>4</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>3, set the value of the current
                    node to <c>4</c>. Make the parent of 4 the current node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>*</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>2, set the root value of the
                    current node to <c>*</c> and create a new right child. The new right child
                    becomes the current node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>5</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>3, set the root value of the
                    current node to <c>5</c>. Make the parent of 5 the current node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>)</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>4 we make the parent of <c>*</c> the
                    current node.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <c>)</c> as the next token. By rule<nbsp/>4 we make the parent of <c>+</c> the
                    current node. At this point there is no parent for <c>+</c> so we are done.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>From the example above, it is clear that we need to keep track of the
            current node as well as the parent of the current node. The tree
            interface provides us with a way to get children of a node, through the
            <c>getLeftChild</c> and <c>getRightChild</c> methods, but how can we keep
            track of the parent? A simple solution to keeping track of parents as we
            traverse the tree is to use a stack. Whenever we want to descend to a
            child of the current node, we first push the current node on the stack.
            When we want to return to the parent of the current node, we pop the
            parent off the stack.</p>
        <p>Using the rules described above, along with the <c>Stack</c> and
            <c>BinaryTree</c> operations, we are now ready to write a C++ function
            to create a parse tree. The code for our parse tree builder is presented
            in <xref ref="lst-buildparse-cpp"/>.</p>

        <p>The four rules for building a parse tree are coded as the first four
            clauses of the <c>if</c> statement on lines 12, 17,
            23, and 26 of <xref ref="lst-buildparse-cpp"/>. In each case you
            can see that the code implements the rule, as described above, with a
            few calls to the <c>BinaryTree</c> or <c>Stack</c> methods. The only error
            checking we do in this function is in the <c>else</c> clause where a
            <c>ValueError</c> exception will be raised if we get a token from the vector
            that we do not recognize.</p>
        <p>Now that we have built a parse tree, what can we do with it? As a first
            example, we will write a function to evaluate the parse tree, returning
            the numerical result. To write this function, we will make use of the
            hierarchical nature of the tree. Look back at <xref ref="fig-meparse"/>.
            Recall that we can replace the original tree with the simplified tree
            shown in <xref ref="fig-mesimple"/>. This suggests that we can write an
            algorithm that evaluates a parse tree by recursively evaluating each
            subtree.</p>
        <p>As we have done with past recursive algorithms, we will begin the design
            for the recursive evaluation function by identifying the base case. A
            natural base case for recursive algorithms that operate on trees is to
            check for a leaf node. In a parse tree, the leaf nodes will always be
            operands. Since numerical objects like integers and floating points
            require no further interpretation, the <c>evaluate</c> function can simply
            return the value stored in the leaf node. The recursive step that moves
            the function toward the base case is to call <c>evaluate</c> on both the
            left and the right children of the current node. The recursive call
            effectively moves us down the tree, toward a leaf node.</p>
        <p>To put the results of the two recursive calls together, we can simply
            apply the operator stored in the parent node to the results returned
            from evaluating both children. In the example from <xref ref="fig-mesimple"/>
            we see that the two children of the root evaluate to themselves, namely
            10 and 3. Applying the multiplication operator gives us a final result
            of 30.</p>
        <p>The code for a recursive <c>evaluate</c> function is shown in
            <xref ref="lst-eval-cpp"/>. First, we obtain references to the left and the
            right children of the current node. If both the left and right children
            evaluate to <c>None</c>, then we know that the current node is really a
            leaf node. This check is on line 7. If the current node is not
            a leaf node, look up the operator in the current node and apply it to
            the results from recursively evaluating the left and right children.</p>
        <p>To implement the arithmetic, we use a dictionary with the keys <c>'+', '-', '*'</c>, and
            <c>'/'</c>. The values stored in the dictionary are functions from C++'s
            operator module. The operator module provides us with the functional
            versions of many commonly used operators. When we look up an operator in
            the dictionary, the corresponding function object is retrieved. Since
            the retrieved object is a function, we can call it in the usual way
            <c>function(param1,param2)</c>. So the lookup <c>opers['+'](2,2)</c> is
            equivalent to <c>operator.add(2,2)</c>.</p>

        <p>Finally, we will trace the <c>evaluate</c> function on the parse tree we
            created in <xref ref="parse_fig-bldexpstep"/>. When we first call <c>evaluate</c>, we
            pass the root of the entire tree as the parameter <c>parseTree</c>. Then we
            obtain references to the left and right children to make sure they
            exist. The recursive call takes place on line 9. We begin
            by looking up the operator in the root of the tree, which is <c>'+'</c>.
            The <c>'+'</c> operator maps to the <c>operator.add</c> function call, which
            takes two parameters. As usual for a C++ function call, the first
            thing C++ does is to evaluate the parameters that are passed to the
            function. In this case both parameters are recursive function calls to
            our <c>evaluate</c> function. Using left-to-right evaluation, the first
            recursive call goes to the left. In the first recursive call the
            <c>evaluate</c> function is given the left subtree. We find that the node
            has no left or right children, so we are in a leaf node. When we are in
            a leaf node we just return the value stored in the leaf node as the
            result of the evaluation. In this case we return the integer 3.</p>
        <p>At this point we have one parameter evaluated for our top-level call to
            <c>operator.add</c>. But we are not done yet. Continuing the left-to-right
            evaluation of the parameters, we now make a recursive call to evaluate
            the right child of the root. We find that the node has both a left and a
            right child so we look up the operator stored in this node, <c>'*'</c>, and
            call this function using the left and right children as the parameters.
            At this point you can see that both recursive calls will be to leaf
            nodes, which will evaluate to the integers four and five respectively.
            With the two parameters evaluated, we return the result of
            <c>operator.mul(4,5)</c>. At this point we have evaluated the operands for
            the top level <c>'+'</c> operator and all that is left to do is finish the
            call to <c>operator.add(3,20)</c>. The result of the evaluation of the
            entire expression tree for <m>(3 + (4 * 5))</m> is 23.</p>
