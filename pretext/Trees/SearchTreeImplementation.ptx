        <p><idx>bst property</idx>A binary search tree relies on the property that
            keys that are less than the parent are found in the left subtree, and
            keys that are greater than the parent are found in the right subtree. We
            will call this the <term>bst property</term>. As we implement the Map interface
            as described above, the bst property will guide our implementation.
            <xref ref="bst_fig-simplebst"/> illustrates this property of a binary search
            tree, showing the keys without any associated values. Notice that the
            property holds for each parent and child. All of the keys in the left
            subtree are less than the key in the root. All of the keys in the right
            subtree are greater than the root.</p>

                    A diagram illustrating a simple binary search tree (BST) structure with the root node labeled "70." 
                    The left child of the root is labeled "31," and the right child is labeled "93." Node "31" has a left child 
                    labeled "14," which in turn has a left child labeled "23." Node "93" has two children: "73" as its left child 
                    and "94" as its right child.
                    This structure adheres to the BST property: each node’s left subtree contains keys less than the node’s key, 
                    and each node’s right subtree contains keys greater than the node’s key.

        <p>Now that you know what a binary search tree is, we will look at how a
            binary search tree is constructed. The search tree in
            <xref ref="bst_fig-simplebst"/> represents the nodes that exist after we have
            inserted the following keys in the order shown:
            <m>70,31,93,94,14,23,73</m>. Since 70 was the first key inserted into
            the tree, it is the root. Next, 31 is less than 70, so it becomes the
            left child of 70. Next, 93 is greater than 70, so it becomes the right
            child of 70. Now we have two levels of the tree filled, so the next key
            is going to be the left or right child of either 31 or 93. Since 94 is
            greater than 70 and 93, it becomes the right child of 93. Similarly 14
            is less than 70 and 31, so it becomes the left child of 31. 23 is also
            less than 31, so it must be in the left subtree of 31. However, it is
            greater than 14, so it becomes the right child of 14.</p>
        <p>To implement the binary search tree, we will use the nodes and
            references approach similar to the one we used to implement the linked
            list, and the expression tree. To effectively manage scenerios where the binary
            search tree might be empty, we use two separate classes.
            The first class we will call <c>BinarySearchTree</c>,
            and the second class we will call <c>TreeNode</c>. The <c>BinarySearchTree</c>
            class has a reference to the <c>TreeNode</c> that is the root of the binary
            search tree. In most cases the external methods defined in the outer
            class simply check to see if the tree is empty. If there are nodes in
            the tree, the request is just passed on to a private method defined in
            the <c>BinarySearchTree</c> class that takes the root as a parameter. In
            the case where the tree is empty or we want to delete the key at the
            root of the tree, we must take special action. The code for the
            <c>BinarySearchTree</c> class constructor along with a few other
            miscellaneous functions is shown in <xref ref="bst_lst-bst1"/>.</p>

            return size;
        }

        </listing>
        <p>The <c>TreeNode</c> class provides many helper functions that make the work
            done in the <c>BinarySearchTree</c> class methods much easier. The
            constructor for a <c>TreeNode</c>, along with these helper functions, is
            shown in <xref ref="bst_lst-bst2"/>. As you can see in the listing many of
            these helper functions help to classify a node according to its own
            position as a child, (left or right) and the kind of children the node
            has.
            The <c>TreeNode</c> class will also explicitly keep track
            of the parent as an attribute of each node. You will see why this is
            important when we discuss the implementation for the <c>del</c> operator.</p>
        <p>Another interesting aspect of the implementation of <c>TreeNode</c> in
            <xref ref="bst_lst-bst2"/> is that we use C++'s optional parameters.
            Optional parameters make it easy for us to create a <c>TreeNode</c> under
            several different circumstances. Sometimes we will want to construct a
            new <c>TreeNode</c> that already has both a <c>parent</c> and a <c>child</c>.
            With an existing parent and child, we can pass parent and child as
            parameters. At other times we will just create a <c>TreeNode</c> with the
            key-value pair, and we will not pass any parameters for <c>parent</c> or
            <c>child</c>. In this case, the default values of the optional parameters
            are used.</p>

        <p>Now that we have the <c>BinarySearchTree</c> shell and the <c>TreeNode</c> it
            is time to write the <c>put</c> method that will allow us to build our
            binary search tree. The <c>put</c> method is a method of the
            <c>BinarySearchTree</c> class. This method will check to see if the tree
            already has a root. If there is not a root then <c>put</c> will create a
            new <c>TreeNode</c> and install it as the root of the tree. If a root node
            is already in place then <c>put</c> calls the private, recursive, helper
            function <c>_put</c> to search the tree according to the following
            algorithm:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>Starting at the root of the tree, search the binary tree comparing
                    the new key to the key in the current node. If the new key is less
                    than the current node, search the left subtree. If the new key is
                    greater than the current node, search the right subtree.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When there is no left (or right) child to search, we have found the
                    position in the tree where the new node should be installed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To add a node to the tree, create a new <c>TreeNode</c> object and
                    insert the object at the point discovered in the previous step.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><xref ref="bst_lst-bst3"/> shows the C++ code for inserting a new node in
            the tree. The <c>_put</c> function is written recursively following the
            steps outlined above. Notice that when a new child is inserted into the
            tree, the <c>currentNode</c> is passed to the new tree as the parent.</p>
        <p>One important problem with our implementation of insert is that
            duplicate keys are not handled properly. As our tree is implemented a
            duplicate key will create a new node with the same key in the
            right subtree of the node having the original key. The result of this is
            that the node with the new key will never be found during a search. A
            better way to handle the insertion of a duplicate key is for the value
            associated with the new key to replace the old value. We leave fixing
            this bug as an exercise for you.</p>

                    The tree has "17" as the root node. The left subtree of "17" contains nodes "5" with left child "2" and right child "16". 
                    The right subtree of "17" contains nodes "35" with a left child "29" and a right child labeled "38." Node "29" has two children: 
                    "33" as its right child and a newly inserted node "19" as its left child. 
                    Lightly shaded nodes ("17," "29," and "19") indicate the nodes visited during the insertion process. The newly added node "19" 
                    is depicted as darkly shaded to highlight it as the most recently added node.

        <p>Once the tree is constructed, the next task is to implement the
            retrieval of a value for a given key. The <c>get</c> method is even easier
            than the <c>put</c> method because it simply searches the tree recursively
            until it gets to a non-matching leaf node or finds a matching key. When

        <p>Finally, we turn our attention to the most challenging method in the
            binary search tree, the deletion of a key (see <xref ref="bst_lst-bst5"/>). The first task is to find the
            node to delete by searching the tree. If the tree has more than one node
            we search using the <c>_get</c> method to find the <c>TreeNode</c> that needs
            to be removed. If the tree only has a single node, that means we are
            removing the root of the tree, but we still must check to make sure the
            key of the root matches the key that is to be deleted. In either case if
            the key is not found the <c>del</c> operator raises an error.</p>

        <p>Once we've found the node containing the key we want to delete, there
            are three cases that we must consider:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>The node to be deleted has no children (see <xref ref="bst_fig-bstdel1"/>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The node to be deleted has only one child (see <xref ref="bst_fig-bstdel2"/>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The node to be deleted has two children (see <xref ref="bst_fig-bstdel3"/>).</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>The first case is straightforward (see <xref ref="bst_lst-bst6"/>). If the current node has no children
            all we need to do is delete the node and remove the reference to this
            node in the parent. The code for this case is shown in here.</p>

        <p>The second case is only slightly more complicated (see <xref ref="bst_lst-bst7"/>). If a node has only a
            single child, then we can simply promote the child to take the place of
            its parent. The code for this case is shown in the next listing. As
            you look at this code you will see that there are six cases to consider.
            Since the cases are symmetric with respect to either having a left or
            right child we will just discuss the case where the current node has a
            left child. The decision proceeds as follows:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>If the current node is a left child then we only need to update the
                    parent reference of the left child to point to the parent of the
                    current node, and then update the left child reference of the parent
                    to point to the current node's left child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the current node is a right child then we only need to update the
                    parent reference of the left child to point to the parent of the
                    current node, and then update the right child reference of the parent
                    to point to the current node's left child.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the current node has no parent, it must be the root. In this case
                    we will just replace the <c>key</c>, <c>value</c>, <c>leftChild</c>, and
                    <c>rightChild</c> data by calling the <c>replaceNodeData</c> method on the
                    root.</p>

                <p>
                    A binary search tree (BST) illustrating the deletion of node "25," which has a single child. Initially, 
                    node "25" is the right child of the root node "17" and has "35" as its single child. After deletion, 
                    node "25" is removed, and its child "35" takes its place in the tree. The tree maintains its BST property, 
                    with all nodes correctly positioned in their respective left or right subtrees. An arrow highlights the 
                    transition from the initial tree to the updated tree structure.

        <p><idx>successor node</idx>The third case is the most difficult case to handle (see <xref ref="bst_lst-bst8"/>). If a node has two
            children, then it is unlikely that we can simply promote one of them to
            take the node's place. We can, however, search the tree for a node that
            can be used to replace the one scheduled for deletion. What we need is a
            node that will preserve the binary search tree relationships for both of
            the existing left and right subtrees. The node that will do this is the
            node that has the next-largest key in the tree. We call this node the
            <term>successor node</term>, and we will look at a way to find the successor shortly.
            The successor is guaranteed to have no more than one child, so we know
            how to remove it using the two cases for deletion that we have already
            implemented. Once the successor has been removed, we simply put it in
            the tree in place of the node to be deleted.</p>

                    A binary search tree (BST) illustrating the deletion of a node with two children, specifically node "5." 
                    The initial tree has "17" as the root. Node "5," highlighted for deletion, has two children: "2" and "11." 
                    To handle this case, the algorithm finds the successor node, which is the smallest node in the right subtree of "5." 
                    The successor node, "7," is identified and highlighted. 

                    The successor node "7" is removed from its original position and placed in the location of the deleted node "5," 
                    preserving the BST properties. The updated tree maintains its hierarchical relationships, with all nodes correctly 
                    positioned according to the BST property. An arrow illustrates the transformation from the initial tree to the updated structure.

        <p>The code to handle the third case is shown in <xref ref="bst_lst-bst8"/>.
            Notice that we make use of the helper methods <c>findSuccessor</c> and
            <c>findMin</c> to find the successor. To remove the successor, we make use
            of the method <c>spliceOut</c>. The reason we use <c>spliceOut</c> is that it
            goes directly to the node we want to splice out and makes the right
            changes. We could call <c>delete</c> recursively, but then we would waste
            time re-searching for the key node.</p>

        <p>The code to find the successor is shown below (see <xref ref="bst_lst-bst9"/>) and as
            you can see is a method of the <c>TreeNode</c> class. This code makes use
            of the same properties of binary search trees that cause an inorder
            traversal to print out the nodes in the tree from smallest to largest.
            There are three cases to consider when looking for the successor:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>If the node has a right child, then the successor is the smallest key
                    in the right subtree.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the node has no right child and is the left child of its parent,
                    then the parent is the successor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the node is the right child of its parent, and itself has no right
                    child, then the successor to this node is the successor of its
                    parent, excluding this node.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>The first condition is the only one that matters for us when deleting a
            node from a binary search tree. However, the <c>findSuccessor</c> method
            has other uses that we will explore in the exercises at the end of this
            chapter.</p>
        <p>The <c>findMin</c> method is called to find the minimum key in a subtree.
            You should convince yourself that the minimum key in any binary
            search tree is the leftmost child of the tree. Therefore the <c>findMin</c>
            method simply follows the <c>leftChild</c> references in each node of the
            subtree until it reaches a node that does not have a left child.</p>
