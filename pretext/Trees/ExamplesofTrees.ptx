        <title>Examples of Trees</title>
        <p>Now that we have studied linear data structures like
            stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look
            at a common data structure called the <term>tree</term>. Trees are used in many
            areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics,
            database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have
            many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data
            structure has a root, branches, and leaves. The difference between a
            tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data
            structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.</p>
        <p>Before we begin our study of tree data structures, let's look at a few
            common examples. Our first example of a tree is a classification tree
            from biology. <xref ref="fig-biotree"/> shows an example of the biological
            classification of some animals. From this simple example, we can learn
            about several properties of trees. The first property this example
            demonstrates is that trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we mean
            that trees are structured in layers with the more general things near
            the top and the more specific things near the bottom. The top of the
            hierarchy is the Kingdom, the next layer of the tree (the <q>children</q> of
            the layer above) is the Phylum, then the Class, and so on. However, no
            matter how deep we go in the classification tree, all the organisms are
            still animals.</p>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-biotree"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Figure 1: Taxonomy of Some Common Animals Shown as a Tree</caption><image source="Trees/Figures/biology.png" width="50%" alt="image"/></figure>
        <p>Notice that you can start at the top of the tree and follow a path made
            of circles and arrows all the way to the bottom. At each level of the
            tree we might ask ourselves a question and then follow the path that
            agrees with our answer. For example we might ask, <q>Is this animal a
            Chordate or an Arthropod?</q> If the answer is <q>Chordate</q> then we follow
            that path and ask, <q>Is this Chordate a Mammal?</q> If not, we are stuck
            (but only in this simplified example). When we are at the Mammal level
            we ask, <q>Is this Mammal a Primate or a Carnivore?</q> We can keep following
            paths until we get to the very bottom of the tree where we have the
            common name.</p>
        <p>A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are
            independent of the children of another node. For example, the Genus
            Felis has the children Domestica and Leo. The Genus Musca also has a
            child named Domestica, but it is a different node and is independent of
            the Domestica child of Felis. This means that we can change the node
            that is the child of Musca without affecting the child of Felis.</p>
        <p>A third property is that each leaf node is unique. We can specify a path
            from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each
            species in the animal kingdom; for example, Animalia
            <m>\rightarrow</m> Chordate <m>\rightarrow</m> Mammal
            <m>\rightarrow</m> Carnivora <m>\rightarrow</m> Felidae
            <m>\rightarrow</m> Felis <m>\rightarrow</m> Domestica.</p>
        <p>Another example of a tree structure that you probably use every day is a
            file system. In a file system, directories, or folders, are structured
            as a tree. <xref ref="fig-filetree"/> illustrates a small part of a Unix file
            system hierarchy.</p>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-filetree"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Figure 2: A Small Part of the Unix File System Hierarchy</caption><image source="Trees/Figures/directory.png" width="50%" alt="image"/></figure>
        <p>The file system tree has much in common with the biological
            classification tree. You can follow a path from the root to any
            directory. That path will uniquely identify that subdirectory (and all
            the files in it). Another important property of trees, derived from
            their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a
            tree (called a <term>subtree</term>) to a different position in the tree without
            affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, we could take
            the entire subtree staring with /etc/, detach etc/ from the root and
            reattach it under usr/. This would change the unique pathname to httpd
            from /etc/httpd to /usr/etc/httpd, but would not affect the contents or
            any children of the httpd directory.</p>
        <p>A final example of a tree is a web page. The following is an example of
            a simple web page written using HTML. <xref ref="fig-html"/> shows the tree
            that corresponds to each of the HTML tags used to create the page.</p>
        <pre>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;simple&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;A simple web page&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;List item one&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;List item two&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="http://www.cs.luther.edu"&gt;Luther CS &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="id3"><caption xmlns:c="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:changeset="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:citation="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:cpp="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:index="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:js="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:math="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:py="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:rst="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/" xmlns:std="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Figure 3: A Tree Corresponding to the Markup Elements of a Web Page</caption><image source="Trees/Figures/htmltree.png" width="50%" alt="image"/></figure>
        <p>The HTML source code and the tree accompanying the source illustrate
            another hierarchy. Notice that each level of the tree corresponds to a
            level of nesting inside the HTML tags. The first tag in the source is
            <c>&lt;html&gt;</c> and the last is <c>&lt;/html&gt;</c> All the rest of the tags in the
            page are inside the pair. If you check, you will see that this nesting
            property is true at all levels of the tree.</p>
