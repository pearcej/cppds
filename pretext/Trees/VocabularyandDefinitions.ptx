    <title>Vocabulary and Definitions</title>
    <p>Now that we have looked at examples of trees, we will formally define a
        tree and its components.</p>
    <p><dl>
        <li>
            <title>Node</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>node</h></idx>
                <p>A <term>node</term> is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name, which we
                    call the <q>key.</q> A node may also have additional information. We call
                    this additional information the <q>payload.</q> While the payload
                    information is not central to many tree algorithms, it is often
                    critical in applications that make use of trees.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Edge</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>edge</h></idx>
                <p>An <term>edge</term> is another fundamental part of a tree. An edge connects two
                    nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. Every node
                    (except the root) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from
                    another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Root</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>root</h></idx>
                <p>The <term>root</term> of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no
                    incoming edges. In <xref ref="trees_examples-filetree"/>, / is the root of the tree.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Path</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>path</h></idx>
                <p>A <term>path</term> is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges. For
                    example,
                    Mammal <m>\rightarrow</m> Carnivora <m>\rightarrow</m> Felidae <m>\rightarrow</m> Felis <m>\rightarrow</m> Domestica
                    is a path.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Children</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>children</h></idx>
                <p>The set of nodes <m>c</m> that have incoming edges from the same
                    node to are said to be the children of that node. In
                    <xref ref="trees_examples-filetree"/>, nodes log/, spool/, and yp/ are the children of node
                    var/.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Parent</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>parent</h></idx>
                <p>A node is the <term>parent</term> of all the nodes it connects to with outgoing
                    edges. In <xref ref="trees_examples-filetree"/> the node var/ is the parent of nodes
                    log/, spool/, and yp/.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Sibling</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>siblings</h></idx>
                <p>Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to
                    be <term>siblings</term>. The nodes etc/ and usr/ are siblings in the filesystem
                    tree.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Subtree</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>subtree</h></idx>
                <p>A <term>subtree</term> is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and all
                    the descendants of that parent.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Leaf Node</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>leaf node</h></idx>
                <p>A <term>leaf node</term> is a node that has no children. For example, Human and
                    Chimpanzee are leaf nodes in <xref ref="trees_examples-biotree"/>.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Level</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>level</h></idx>
                <p>The <term>level</term> of a node <m>n</m> is the number of edges on the path
                    from the root node to <m>n</m>. For example, the level of the
                    Felis node in <xref ref="trees_examples-biotree"/> is five. By definition, the level
                    of the root node is zero.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <title>Height</title>
            <idx><h>Tree Components</h><h>height</h></idx>
                <p>The <term>height</term> of a tree is equal to the maximum level of any node in
                    the tree. The height of the tree in <xref ref="trees_examples-filetree"/> is two.</p>
            
        </li>
    </dl></p>
    <p>With the basic vocabulary now defined, we can move on to a formal
        definition of a tree. In fact, we will provide two definitions of a
        tree. One definition involves nodes and edges. The second definition,
        which will prove to be very useful, is a recursive definition.</p>
    <p><em>Definition One:</em> A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of
        edges that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>
            <p>One node of the tree is designated as the root node.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Every node <m>n</m>, except the root node, is connected by an edge
                from exactly one other node <m>p</m>, where <m>p</m> is the
                parent of <m>n</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A unique path traverses from the root to each node.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that
                the tree is a <term>binary tree</term>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><xref ref="fig-nodeedgetree"/> illustrates a tree that fits definition one.
        The arrowheads on the edges indicate the direction of the connection.</p>

        <caption>A Tree Consisting of a Set of Nodes and Edges.</caption>
            <image source="Trees/treedef1.png" width="50%">
            <description><p>The image shows a basic conceptual diagram of a tree data structure, consisting of a set of nodes connected by edges. The top of the tree features a 'rootnode', which branches into 'child1' and 'child2'. Below 'child1', there is 'node1' with three children labeled 'child1', 'child2', and 'child3', while 'child2' branches into 'node2' with a single 'child1'. Further down, 'node1' branches into 'node3', 'node4', and 'node5', and 'node2' branches into 'node6'. The nodes are represented by rectangles, and the connecting lines represent the edges of the tree.</p></description>

        </figure>
    <p><em>Definition Two:</em> A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero
        or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree. The root of each subtree
        is connected to the root of the parent tree by an edge.
        <xref ref="fig-recursivetree"/> illustrates this recursive definition of a tree.
        Using the recursive definition of a tree, we know that the tree in
        <xref ref="fig-recursivetree"/> has at least four nodes, since each of the
        triangles representing a subtree must have a root. It may have many more
        nodes than that, but we do not know unless we look deeper into the tree.</p>

        <caption>A recursive Definition of a tree.</caption>
            <image source="Trees/TreeDefRecursive.png" width="50%">
            <description><p>The image presents a simplified diagram of a tree data structure with a single 'root' node at the top, branching out into three 'subtrees' labeled 'subtree-1', 'subtree-2', and 'subtree-3'. This visual model illustrates the concept of recursion in data structures, where each subtree can be seen as a smaller instance of the larger structure.</p></description>
