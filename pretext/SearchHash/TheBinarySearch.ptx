        <title>The Binary Search</title>
        <p>It is possible to take greater advantage of the ordered vector if we are
            clever with our comparisons. In the sequential search, when we compare
            against the first item, there are at most <m>n-1</m> more items to
            look through if the first item is not what we are looking for. <idx>binary search</idx>
            Instead
            of searching the vector in sequence, a <term>binary search</term> will start by
            examining the middle item. If that item is the one we are searching for,
            we are done. If it is not the correct item, we can use the ordered
            nature of the vector to eliminate half of the remaining items. If the item
            we are searching for is greater than the middle item, we know that the
            entire lower half of the vector as well as the middle item can be
            eliminated from further consideration. The item, if it is in the vector,
            must be in the upper half.</p>
        <p>We can then repeat the process with the upper half. Start at the middle
            item and compare it against what we are looking for. Again, we either
            find it or split the vector in half, therefore eliminating another large
            part of our possible search space. <xref ref="fig-binsearch"/> shows how this
            algorithm can quickly find the value 54. The complete function is shown
            in <xref ref="lst-binarysearchpy"/>.</p>

        <p>Before we move on to the analysis, we should note that this algorithm is
            a great example of a divide and conquer strategy. Divide and conquer
            means that we divide the problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller
            pieces in some way, and then reassemble the whole problem to get the
            result. When we perform a binary search of a list, we first check the
            middle item. If the item we are searching for is less than the middle
            item, we can simply perform a binary search of the left half of the
            original list. Likewise, if the item is greater, we can perform a binary
            search of the right half. Either way, this is a recursive call to the
            binary search function passing a smaller list. <xref ref="lst-recbinarysearch"/>
            shows this recursive version.</p>
        
        <p>There is a vector initializer within C++ that can be used much like python slices,
            however this can only be used when new vectors are created.</p>

            <title>Analysis of Binary Search</title>
            <p>To analyze the binary search algorithm, we need to recall that each
                comparison eliminates about half of the remaining items from
                consideration. What is the maximum number of comparisons this algorithm
                will require to check the entire list? If we start with <em>n</em> items, about
                <m>\frac{n}{2}</m> items will be left after the first comparison.
                After the second comparison, there will be about <m>\frac{n}{4}</m>.
                Then <m>\frac{n}{8}</m>, <m>\frac{n}{16}</m>, and so on. How many
                times can we split the list? <xref ref="search-hash_tbl-binaryanalysis"/> helps us to see the

            <p>When we split the list enough times, we end up with a list that has just
                one item. Either that is the item we are looking for or it is not.
                Either way, we are done. The number of comparisons necessary to get to
                this point is <em>i</em> where <m>\frac {n}{2^i} =1</m>. Solving for <em>i</em>
                gives us <m>i=\log n</m>. The maximum number of comparisons is
                logarithmic with respect to the number of items in the list. Therefore,
                the binary search is <m>O(\log n)</m>.</p>
            <p>One additional analysis issue needs to be addressed. In the recursive
                solution shown above, the recursive call,</p>
            <p><c>binarySearch(alist[:midpoint],item)</c></p>
            <p>uses the slice operator to create the left half of the list that is then
                passed to the next invocation (similarly for the right half as well).
                The analysis that we did above assumed that the slice operator takes
                constant time. This means that the binary search using slice will not
                perform in strict logarithmic time. Luckily this can be remedied by
                passing the list along with the starting and ending indices. The indices
                can be calculated as we did in <xref ref="lst-binarysearchpy"/>. This is especially relevant in C++, where we are initializing a new vector for each split of our list. To truly optimize this algorithm, we could use an array and manually keep track of start and end indices of our array. Below is an example of such an implementation.</p>

            <p>Even though a binary search is generally better than a sequential
                search, it is important to note that for small values of <em>n</em>, the
                additional cost of sorting is probably not worth it. In fact, we should
                always consider whether it is cost effective to take on the extra work
                of sorting to gain searching benefits. If we can sort once and then
                search many times, the cost of the sort is not so significant. However,
                for large lists, sorting even once can be so expensive that simply
                performing a sequential search from the start may be the best choice.</p>
