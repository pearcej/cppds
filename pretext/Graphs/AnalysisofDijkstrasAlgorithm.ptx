        <title>Analysis of Dijkstra's Algorithm</title>
        <p>Finally, let us look at the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm. We
            first note that building the priority queue takes <m>O(V)</m> time
            since we initially add every vertex in the graph to the priority queue.
            Once the queue is constructed the <c>while</c> loop
            is executed once for every vertex since vertices are all added at the
            beginning and only removed after that. Within that loop each call to
            <c>delMin</c>, takes <m>O(\log V)</m> time. Taken together that part of
            the loop and the calls to delMin take <m>O(V \log(V))</m>. The
            <c>for</c> loop is executed once for each edge in the
            graph, and within the <c>for</c> loop the call to <c>decreaseKey</c> takes
            time <m>O(E\log(V)).</m> So the combined running time is <m>O((V+E) \log(V)).</m></p>
