        <title>Vocabulary and Definitions</title>
        <p>Now that we have looked at some examples of graphs, we will more
            formally define a graph and its components. We already know some of
            these terms from our discussion of trees.</p>
        <dl>
            <li>
                <title>Vertex</title>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>vertex</h></idx>
                    <p>A vertex (also called a <q>node</q>) is a fundamental part of a graph. It
                        can have a name, which we will call the <q>key.</q> A vertex may also
                        have additional information. We will call this additional
                        information the <q>payload.</q></p>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Edge</title>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>edge</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>directed graph</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>digraph</h></idx>
                    <p>An edge (also called an <q>arc</q>) is another fundamental part of a
                        graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a
                        relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the
                        edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a
                        <term>directed graph</term>, or a <term>digraph</term>. The class prerequisites graph
                        shown above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes
                        before others.</p>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Weight</title>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>weight</h></idx>
                    <p>Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one
                        vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one
                        city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance
                        between the two cities.</p>
                
            </li>
        </dl>
        <p>With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph
            can be represented by <m>G</m> where <m>G =(V,E)</m>. For the
            graph <m>G</m>, <m>V</m> is a set of vertices and <m>E</m> is a
            set of edges. Each edge is a tuple <m>(v,w)</m> where
            <m>w,v \in V</m>. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to
            represent a weight. A subgraph <m>s</m> is a set of edges <m>e</m>
            and vertices <m>v</m> such that <m>e \subset E</m> and
            <m>v \subset V</m>.</p>
        <p><xref ref="fig-dgsimple"/> shows another example of a simple weighted
            digraph. Formally we can represent this graph as the set of six
            vertices:</p>
        <m docname="Graphs/VocabularyandDefinitions" label="True" nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">V = \left\{ V0,V1,V2,V3,V4,V5 \right\}</m>
        <p>and the set of nine edges:</p>
        <m docname="Graphs/VocabularyandDefinitions" label="True" nowrap="False" number="True" xml:space="preserve">E = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}(v0,v1,5), (v1,v2,4), (v2,v3,9), (v3,v4,7), (v4,v0,1), \\
             (v0,v5,2),(v5,v4,8),(v3,v5,3),(v5,v2,1)
             \end{array} \right\}</m>

                <description>Diagram representing a simple directed graph with vertices labeled V0 to V5. Arrows indicating direction connect the vertices, with weights on each edge. V0 connects to V4 and V1 with weights 1 and 5, respectively. V1 is connected from V0 and to V5 with weights 5 and 4, respectively. V2 connects from V3 and V5 with weights 9 and 1, respectively. V3 connects to V2 and V5 with weights 9 and 3, respectively, and also to V4 with a weight of 7. V4 connects from V0 and V5 with weights 1 and 8, respectively, and to V3 with a weight of 7. V5, at the center, has incoming edges from V1, V3, and V4 with weights 4, 3, and 8, respectively, and outgoing edges to V2 with a weight of 1. </description>

        <p>The example graph in <xref ref="fig-dgsimple"/> helps illustrate two other
            key graph terms:</p>
        <dl>
            <li>
                <title>Path</title>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>path</h></idx>
                    <p>A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by
                        edges. Formally we would define a path as
                        <m>w_1, w_2, ..., w_n</m> such that
                        <m>(w_i, w_{i+1}) \in E</m> for all <m>1 \le i \le n-1</m>.
                        The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path,
                        specifically <m>n-1</m>. The weighted path length is the sum of
                        the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in
                        <xref ref="fig-dgsimple"/> the path from <m>V3</m> to <m>V1</m> is
                        the sequence of vertices <m>(V3,V4,V0,V1)</m>. The edges are
                        <m>\left\{(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v1,5) \right\}</m>.</p>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <title>Cycle</title>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>cycle</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>acyclic graph</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>directed acyclic graph</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Graph Components</h><h>DAG</h></idx>
                    <p>A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the
                        same vertex. For example, in <xref ref="fig-dgsimple"/> the path
                        <m>(V5,V2,V3,V5)</m> is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called
                        an <term>acyclic graph</term>. A directed graph with no cycles is called a
                        <term>directed acyclic graph</term> or a <term>DAG</term>. We will see that we can
                        solve several important problems if the problem can be represented
                        as a DAG.</p>
