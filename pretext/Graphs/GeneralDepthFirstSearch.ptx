        <title>General Depth First Search</title>
        <p>The knight's tour is a special case of a depth first search where the
            goal is to create the deepest depth first tree, without any branches.
            The more general depth first search is actually easier. Its goal is to
            search as deeply as possible, connecting as many nodes in the graph as
            possible and branching where necessary.</p>
        <p>
            <idx>depth first forest</idx>
            It is even possible that a depth first search will create more than one
            tree. When the depth first search algorithm creates a group of trees we
            call this a <term>depth first forest</term>. As with the breadth first search our
            depth first search makes use of predecessor links to construct the tree.
            In addition, the depth first search will make use of two additional
            instance variables in the <c>Vertex</c> class. The new instance variables
            are the discovery and finish times. The discovery time tracks the number
            of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is first encountered. The
            finish time is the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is
            colored black. As we will see after looking at the algorithm, the
            discovery and finish times of the nodes provide some interesting
            properties we can use in later algorithms.</p>
        <p>The code for our depth first search is shown in <term>Listing 5</term>. Since
            the two functions <c>dfs</c> and its helper <c>dfsvisit</c> use a variable to
            keep track of the time across calls to <c>dfsvisit</c> we chose to
            implement the code as methods of a class that inherits from the
            <c>Graph</c> class. This implementation extends the graph class by adding a
            <c>time</c> instance variable and the two methods <c>dfs</c> and <c>dfsvisit</c>.
            Looking at line<nbsp/>11 you will notice that the <c>dfs</c> method
            iterates over all of the vertices in the graph calling <c>dfsvisit</c> on
            the nodes that are white. The reason we iterate over all the nodes,
            rather than simply searching from a chosen starting node, is to make
            sure that all nodes in the graph are considered and that no vertices are
            left out of the depth first forest. It may look unusual to see the
            statement <c>for aVertex in self</c>, but remember that in this case <c>self</c>
            is an instance of the <c>DFSGraph</c> class, and iterating over all the
            vertices in an instance of a graph is a natural thing to do.</p>

        <p>Although our implementation of <c>bfs</c> was only interested in
            considering nodes for which there was a path leading back to the start,
            it is possible to create a breadth first forest that represents the
            shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph. We leave this as
            an exercise. In our next two algorithms we will see why keeping track of
            the depth first forest is important.</p>
        <p>The <c>dfsvisit</c> method starts with a single vertex called
            <c>startVertex</c> and explores all of the neighboring white vertices as
            deeply as possible. If you look carefully at the code for <c>dfsvisit</c>
            and compare it to breadth first search, what you should notice is that
            the <c>dfsvisit</c> algorithm is almost identical to <c>bfs</c> except that on
            the last line of the inner <c>for</c> loop, <c>dfsvisit</c> calls itself
            recursively to continue the search at a deeper level, whereas <c>bfs</c>
            adds the node to a queue for later exploration. It is interesting to
            note that where <c>bfs</c> uses a queue, <c>dfsvisit</c> uses a stack. You
            don't see a stack in the code, but it is implicit in the recursive call
            to <c>dfsvisit</c>.</p>
        <p>The following sequence of figures illustrates the depth first search algorithm in
            action for a small graph. In these figures, the dotted lines
            indicate edges that are checked, but the node at the other end of the
            edge has already been added to the depth first tree. In the code this
            test is done by checking that the color of the other node is non-white.</p>
        <p>The search begins at vertex A of the graph (<xref ref="fig-gdfsa"/>). Since all of the vertices
            are white at the beginning of the search the algorithm visits vertex A.
            The first step in visiting a vertex is to set the color to gray, which
            indicates that the vertex is being explored and the discovery time is
            set to 1. Since vertex A has two adjacent vertices (B, D) each of those
            need to be visited as well. We'll make the arbitrary decision that we
            will visit the adjacent vertices in alphabetical order.</p>
        <p>Vertex B is visited next (<xref ref="fig-gdfsb"/>), so its color is set to gray and its discovery
            time is set to 2. Vertex B is also adjacent to two other nodes (C, D) so
            we will follow the alphabetical order and visit node C next.</p>
        <p>Visiting vertex C (<xref ref="fig-gdfsc"/>) brings us to the end of one branch of the tree. After
            coloring the node gray and setting its discovery time to 3, the
            algorithm also determines that there are no adjacent vertices to C. This
            means that we are done exploring node C and so we can color the vertex
            black, and set the finish time to 4. You can see the state of our search
            at this point in <xref ref="fig-gdfsd"/>.</p>
        <p>Since vertex C was the end of one branch we now return to vertex B and
            continue exploring the nodes adjacent to B. The only additional vertex
            to explore from B is D, so we can now visit D (<xref ref="fig-gdfse"/>) and continue our search
            from vertex D. Vertex D quickly leads us to vertex E (<xref ref="fig-gdfsf"/>). Vertex E has two
            adjacent vertices, B and F. Normally we would explore these adjacent
            vertices alphabetically, but since B is already colored gray the
            algorithm recognizes that it should not visit B since doing so would put
            the algorithm in a loop! So exploration continues with the next vertex
            in the list, namely F (<xref ref="fig-gdfsg"/>).</p>
        <p>Vertex F has only one adjacent vertex, C, but since C is colored black
            there is nothing else to explore, and the algorithm has reached the end
            of another branch. From here on, you will see in <xref ref="fig-gdfsh"/> through
            <xref ref="fig-gdfsl"/><nbsp/> that the algorithm works its way back to the first node,
            setting finish times and coloring vertices black.</p>
