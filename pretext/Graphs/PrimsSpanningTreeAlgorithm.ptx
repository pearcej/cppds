        <title>Prim's Spanning Tree Algorithm</title>
        <p>For our last graph algorithm let's consider a problem that online game
            designers and Internet radio providers face. The problem is that they
            want to efficiently transfer a piece of information to anyone and
            everyone who may be listening. This is important in gaming so that all
            the players know the very latest position of every other player. This is
            important for Internet radio so that all the listeners that are tuned in
            are getting all the data they need to reconstruct the song they are
            listening to. <xref ref="fig-bcast1"/> illustrates the broadcast problem.</p>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-bcast1">
            <caption>The Broadcast Problem</caption>
                <image source="Graphs/bcast1.png" width="80%">
                <description>The image illustrates a network graph representing the Broadcast Problem. It features seven nodes labeled A through G, with node A designated as the broadcast host. Directed edges connect the nodes, indicating the flow of the broadcast signal, with weights on the edges representing the cost or time of transmission. Four of the nodes are marked as listeners, depicted with computer icons. These listeners are at the terminus of the broadcast paths, showing the direction and flow of information from the host to the listeners through the network.</description>
                </image>
            </figure>
        <p>There are some brute force solutions to this problem, so let's look at
            them first to help understand the broadcast problem better. This will
            also help you appreciate the solution that we will propose when we are
            done. To begin, the broadcast host has some information that the
            listeners all need to receive. The simplest solution is for the
            broadcasting host to keep a list of all of the listeners and send
            individual messages to each. In <xref ref="fig-bcast1"/> we show a small
            network with a broadcaster and some listeners. Using this first
            approach, four copies of every message would be sent. Assuming that the
            least cost path is used, let's see how many times each router would
            handle the same message.</p>
        <p>All messages from the broadcaster go through router A, so A sees all
            four copies of every message. Router C sees only one copy of each
            message for its listener. However, routers B and D would see three
            copies of every message since routers B and D are on the cheapest path
            for listeners 1, 2, and 3. When you consider that the broadcast host
            must send hundreds of messages each second for a radio broadcast, that
            is a lot of extra traffic.</p>
        <p><idx>uncontrolled flooding</idx>
            A brute force solution is for the broadcast host to send a single copy
            of the broadcast message and let the routers sort things out. In this
            case, the easiest solution is a strategy called <term>uncontrolled
                flooding</term>. The flooding strategy works as follows. Each message starts
            with a time to live (<c>ttl</c>) value set to some number greater than or
            equal to the number of edges between the broadcast host and its most
            distant listener. Each router gets a copy of the message and passes the
            message on to <em>all</em> of its neighboring routers. When the message is
            passed on the <c>ttl</c> is decreased. Each router continues to send copies
            of the message to all its neighbors until the <c>ttl</c> value reaches 0.
            It is easy to convince yourself that uncontrolled flooding generates
            many more unnecessary messages than our first strategy.</p>
        <p><idx>minimum weight spanning tree</idx>
            The solution to this problem lies in the construction of a minimum
            weight <term>spanning tree</term>. Formally we define the minimum spanning tree
            <m>T</m> for a graph <m>G = (V,E)</m> as follows. <m>T</m> is
            an acyclic subset of <m>E</m> that connects all the vertices in
            <m>V</m>. The sum of the weights of the edges in T is minimized.</p>
        <p><xref ref="fig-mst1"/> shows a simplified version of the broadcast graph and
            highlights the edges that form a minimum spanning tree for the graph.
            Now to solve our broadcast problem, the broadcast host simply sends a
            single copy of the broadcast message into the network. Each router
            forwards the message to any neighbor that is part of the spanning tree,
            excluding the neighbor that just sent it the message. In this example A
            forwards the message to B. B forwards the message to D and C. D forwards
            the message to E, which forwards it to F, which forwards it to G. No
            router sees more than one copy of any message, and all the listeners
            that are interested see a copy of the message.</p>

                <description>This image depicts a network graph titled "Minimum Spanning Tree for the Broadcast Graph". It consists of seven circular nodes labeled A through G, connected by lines which represent the edges of the tree. Each edge is marked with a number indicating the weight or cost associated with that connection. The structure is tree-like, with no cycles, starting from node A and branching out to all other nodes through the path of minimum total weight. Nodes B, C, E, F, and G are connected with the least number of edges to ensure coverage of the entire network, illustrating the concept of a minimum spanning tree in graph theory.</description>

            </figure>
        <p>The algorithm we will use to solve this problem is called Prim's
            algorithm. Prim's algorithm belongs to a family of algorithms called the
            <q>greedy algorithms</q> because at each step we will choose the cheapest
            next step. In this case the cheapest next step is to follow the edge
            with the lowest weight. Our last step is to develop Prim's algorithm.</p>
        <p>The basic idea in constructing a spanning tree is as follows:</p>
        <pre>While T is not yet a spanning tree
   Find an edge that is safe to add to the tree
   Add the new edge to T</pre>
        <p>The trick is in the step that directs us to <q>find an edge that is safe.</q>
            We define a safe edge as any edge that connects a vertex that is in the
            spanning tree to a vertex that is not in the spanning tree. This ensures
            that the tree will always remain a tree and therefore have no cycles.</p>
        <p>The Python code to implement Prim's algorithm is shown in <term>Listing 2</term>. Prim's algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm
            in that they both use a priority queue to select the next vertex to add
            to the growing graph.</p>

        <pre>from pythonds.graphs import PriorityQueue, Graph, Vertex

def prim(G,start):
    pq = PriorityQueue()
    for v in G:
        v.setDistance(sys.maxsize)
        v.setPred(None)
    start.setDistance(0)
    pq.buildHeap([(v.getDistance(),v) for v in G])
    while not pq.isEmpty():
        currentVert = pq.delMin()
        for nextVert in currentVert.getConnections():
          newCost = currentVert.getWeight(nextVert)
          if nextVert in pq and newCost&lt;nextVert.getDistance():
              nextVert.setPred(currentVert)
              nextVert.setDistance(newCost)
              pq.decreaseKey(nextVert,newCost)</pre>
        <p>The following sequence of figures (<xref ref="fig-mst1"/> through <xref ref="fig-mst1"/>) shows the algorithm in operation on our sample
            tree. We begin with the starting vertex as A. The distances to all the
            other vertices are initialized to infinity. Looking at the neighbors of
            A we can update distances to two of the additional vertices B and C
            because the distances to B and C through A are less than infinite. This
            moves B and C to the front of the priority queue. Update the predecessor
            links for B and C by setting them to point to A. It is important to note
            that we have not formally added B or C to the spanning tree yet. A node
            is not considered to be part of the spanning tree until it is removed
            from the priority queue.</p>
        <p>Since B has the smallest distance we look at B next. Examining B's
            neighbors we see that D and E can be updated. Both D and E get new
            distance values and their predecessor links are updated. Moving on to
            the next node in the priority queue we find C. The only node C is
            adjacent to that is still in the priority queue is F, thus we can update
            the distance to F and adjust F's position in the priority queue.</p>
        <p>Now we examine the vertices adjacent to node D. We find that we can
            update E and reduce the distance to E from 6 to 4. When we do this we
            change the predecessor link on E to point back to D, thus preparing it
            to be grafted into the spanning tree but in a different location. The
            rest of the algorithm proceeds as you would expect, adding each new node
            to the tree.</p>

                <description>This image illustrates the process of Prim's algorithm applied to a graph. The graph has seven circular nodes labeled A through G, connected by lines with numbers indicating the weight of the edges. The algorithm starts at node A and progressively selects the edge with the lowest weight that connects a node inside the tree to a node outside the tree. As a result, the nodes are incrementally connected in a way that keeps the total weight of the tree at a minimum. The letters B, C, D, E, F, and G at the bottom signify the order in which the nodes are added to the growing tree.</description>
