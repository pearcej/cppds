        <title>Dijkstra's Algorithm</title>
        <p>The algorithm we are going to use to determine the shortest path is
            called <q>Dijkstra's algorithm.</q> Dijkstra's algorithm is an iterative
            algorithm that provides us with the shortest path from one particular
            starting node to all other nodes in the graph. Again this is similar to
            the results of a breadth first search.</p>
        <p>To keep track of the total cost from the start node to each destination
            we will make use of the <c>dist</c> variable in the Vertex class.
            The <c>dist</c> variable will contain the current total weight of
            the smallest weight path from the start to the vertex in question. The
            algorithm iterates once for every vertex in the graph; however, the
            order that we iterate over the vertices is controlled by a priority
            queue. The value that is used to determine the order of the objects in
            the priority queue is <c>dist</c>. When a vertex is first created <c>dist</c>
            is set to a very large number. Theoretically you would set <c>dist</c> to
            infinity, but in practice we just set it to a number that is larger than
            any real distance we would have in the problem we are trying to solve.</p>
        <p>The code for Dijkstra's algorithm is shown in <xref ref="graphs_lst-shortpath"/>. When the algorithm finishes the distances are set
            correctly as are the predecessor links for each vertex in the graph.</p>

        <pre>from pythonds.graphs import PriorityQueue, Graph, Vertex
def dijkstra(aGraph,start):
    pq = PriorityQueue()
    start.setDistance(0)
    pq.buildHeap([(v.getDistance(),v) for v in aGraph])
    while not pq.isEmpty():
        currentVert = pq.delMin()
        for nextVert in currentVert.getConnections():
            newDist = currentVert.getDistance() \
                    + currentVert.getWeight(nextVert)
            if newDist &lt; nextVert.getDistance():
                nextVert.setDistance( newDist )
                nextVert.setPred(currentVert)
                pq.decreaseKey(nextVert,newDist)</pre>
        <p>Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue. You may recall that a
            priority queue is based on the heap that we implemented in the Tree Chapter.
            There are a couple of differences between that
            simple implementation and the implementation we
            use for Dijkstra's algorithm. First, the <c>PriorityQueue</c> class stores
            tuples of key, value pairs. This is important for Dijkstra's algorithm
            as the key in the priority queue must match the key of the vertex in the
            graph. Secondly the value is used for deciding the priority, and thus
            the position of the key in the priority queue. In this implementation we
            use the distance to the vertex as the priority because as we will see
            when we are exploring the next vertex, we always want to explore the
            vertex that has the smallest distance. The second difference is the
            addition of the <c>decreaseKey</c> method. As you can see, this method is used when the distance to a vertex that
            is already in the queue is reduced, and thus moves that vertex toward
            the front of the queue.</p>
        <p>Let's walk through an application of Dijkstra's algorithm one vertex at
            a time using the following sequence of figures as our guide. We begin with the vertex
            <math>u</math>. The three vertices adjacent to <math>u</math> are
            <math>v,w,</math> and <math>x</math>. Since the initial distances to
            <math>v,w,</math> and <math>x</math> are all initialized to <c>sys.maxint</c>,
            the new costs to get to them through the start node are all their direct
            costs. So we update the costs to each of these three nodes. We also set
            the predecessor for each node to <math>u</math> and we add each node to the
            priority queue. We use the distance as the key for the priority queue.
            The state of the algorithm is shown in <xref ref="fig-dija"/>.</p>
        <p>In the next iteration of the <c>while</c> loop we examine the vertices that
            are adjacent to <math>x</math>. The vertex <math>x</math> is next because it
            has the lowest overall cost and therefore bubbled its way to the
            beginning of the priority queue. At <math>x</math> we look at its neighbors
            <math>u,v,w</math> and <math>y</math>. For each neighboring vertex we check to
            see if the distance to that vertex through <math>x</math> is smaller than
            the previously known distance. Obviously this is the case for
            <math>y</math> since its distance was <c>sys.maxint</c>. It is not the case
            for <math>u</math> or <math>v</math> since their distances are 0 and 2
            respectively. However, we now learn that the distance to <math>w</math> is
            smaller if we go through <math>x</math> than from <math>u</math> directly to
            <math>w</math>. Since that is the case we update <math>w</math> with a new
            distance and change the predecessor for <math>w</math> from <math>u</math> to
            <math>x</math>. See <xref ref="fig-dijb"/> for the state of all the vertices.</p>
        <p>The next step is to look at the vertices neighboring <math>v</math> (see <xref ref="fig-dijc"/>). This
            step results in no changes to the graph, so we move on to node
            <math>y</math>. At node <math>y</math> (see <xref ref="fig-dijd"/>) we discover that it is cheaper to get
            to both <math>w</math> and <math>z</math>, so we adjust the distances and
            predecessor links accordingly. Finally we check nodes <math>w</math> and
            <math>z</math> (see see <xref ref="fig-dije"/> and see <xref ref="fig-dijf"/>). However, no additional changes are found and so the
            priority queue is empty and Dijkstra's algorithm exits.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that Dijkstra's algorithm works only when the
            weights are all positive. You should convince yourself that if you
            introduced a negative weight on one of the edges to the graph that the algorithm would never exit.</p>
        <p>We will note that to route messages through the Internet, other
            algorithms are used for finding the shortest path. One of the problems
            with using Dijkstra's algorithm on the Internet is that you must have a
            complete representation of the graph in order for the algorithm to run.
            The implication of this is that every router has a complete map of all
            the routers in the Internet. In practice this is not the case and other
            variations of the algorithm allow each router to discover the graph as
            they go. One such algorithm that you may want to read about is called
            the <q>distance vector</q> routing algorithm.</p>
