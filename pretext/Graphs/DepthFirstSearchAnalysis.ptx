        <title>Depth First Search Analysis</title>
        <p>The general running time for depth first search is as follows. The loops
            in <c>dfs</c> both run in <m>O(V)</m>,
            not counting what happens in <c>dfsvisit</c>, since they are executed once
            for each vertex in the graph. In <c>dfsvisit</c> the loop is executed once for each edge in the adjacency
            list of the current vertex. Since <c>dfsvisit</c> is only called
            recursively if the vertex is white, the loop will execute a maximum of
            once for every edge in the graph or <m>O(E)</m>. So, the total time
            for depth first search is <m>O(V + E)</m>.</p>
