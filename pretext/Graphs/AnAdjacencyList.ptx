        <title>An Adjacency List</title>
        <p>A more space-efficient way to implement a sparsely connected graph is to
            use an adjacency list. In an adjacency list implementation we keep a
            master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex
            object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is
            connected to. In our implementation of the <c>Vertex</c> class we will use
            a dictionary rather than a list where the dictionary keys are the
            vertices, and the values are the weights. <xref ref="fig-adjlist"/>
            illustrates the adjacency list representation for the graph in
            <xref ref="fig-dgsimple"/>.</p>

                <description><p>Image displaying an adjacency list representation of a graph. The illustration shows a table labeled 'Graph' with a column 'vertList' containing vertices 'V0' through 'V5'. Next to each vertex is a corresponding vertex object, with 'id' representing the vertex ID and 'adj' listing its adjacent vertices along with the edge weights. For example, 'V0' has an adjacent vertex 'V1' with a weight of 5 and 'V5' with a weight of 2, 'V1' is adjacent to 'V2' with a weight of 4, and so on. The bottom of the table states 'numVertices = 6', indicating the total number of vertices in the graph.</p></description>

        <p>The advantage of the adjacency list implementation is that it allows us
            to compactly represent a sparse graph. The adjacency list also allows us
            to easily find all the links that are directly connected to a particular
            vertex.</p>
