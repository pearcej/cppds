        <title>Exploring a Maze</title>
        <p>In this section we will look at a problem that has relevance to the
            expanding world of robotics: How do you find your way out of a maze? If you have
            a Roomba vacuum cleaner for your dorm room (don't all college students?)
            you will wish that you could reprogram it using what you have learned in
            this section. The problem we want to solve is to find an exit to a virtual maze
            when starting at a pre-defined location. The maze problem has roots as deep as the
            Greek myth about Theseus who was sent into a maze to kill the minotaur.
            Theseus used a ball of thread to help him find his way back out again
            once he had finished off the beast. In our problem we will assume that
            our starting position is dropped down somewhere into the middle of the maze,
            a fair distance from any exit. Look at <xref ref="recursion-fig-maze"/> to get an idea of
            where we are going in this section.</p>

        <figure xml:id="recursion-fig-maze">

        </figure>

        <p>To make it easier for us we will assume that our maze is divided up into
            <q>squares.</q> Each square of the maze is either open or occupied by a
            section of wall. We can only pass through the open squares of
            the maze. If we bump into a wall, we must try a different
            direction. We will require a systematic procedure to find our
            way out of the maze. Here is the procedure:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>From our starting position we will first try going North one square
                    and then recursively try our procedure from there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If we are not successful by trying a Northern path as the first step
                    then we will take a step to the South and recursively repeat our
                    procedure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If South does not work then we will try a step to the West as our
                    first step and recursively apply our procedure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If North, South, and West have not been successful then apply the
                    procedure recursively from a position one step to our East.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If none of these directions works then there is no way to get out of
                    the maze and we fail.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Now, that sounds pretty easy, but there are a couple of details to talk
            about first. Suppose we take our first recursive step by going North. By
            following our procedure our next step would also be to the North. But if
            the North is blocked by a wall we must look at the next step of the
            procedure and try going to the South. Unfortunately that step to the
            south brings us right back to our original starting place. If we apply
            the recursive procedure from there we will just go back one step to the
            North and be in an infinite loop. So, we must have a strategy to
            remember where we have been. In this case we will assume that we have a
            bag of bread crumbs we can drop along our way. If we take a step in a
            certain direction and find that there is a bread crumb already on that
            square, we know that we should immediately back up and try the next
            direction in our procedure. As we will see when we look at the code for
            this algorithm, backing up is as simple as returning from a recursive
            function call.</p>
        <p>As we do for all recursive algorithms let us review the base cases. Some
            of them you may already have guessed based on the description in the
            previous paragraph. In this algorithm, there are four base cases to
            consider:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>We have run into a wall. Since the square is occupied by a
                    wall no further exploration can take place.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We have found a square that has already been explored. We do
                    not want to continue exploring from this position or we will get into
                    a loop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We have found an outside edge, not occupied by a wall. In other words
                    we have found an exit from the maze.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We have explored a square unsuccessfully in all four directions.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>For our program to work we will need to have a way to represent the
            maze. In this instance, we will stick to a text-only representation (ASCII).</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>__init__</c> Initializes basic variables to default values, and calls <c>readMazeFile</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>readMazeFile</c> Reads the text of the maze text file, and calls <c>findStartPosition</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>findStartPosition</c> Finds the row and column of the starting position.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>isOnEdge</c> Checks to see if the current position is on the edge, and therefore an exit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>print</c> Prints the text of the maze to the screen.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The <c>Maze</c> class also overloads the index operator <c>[]</c> so that our
            algorithm can easily access the status of any particular square.</p>
        <p>Let's examine the code for the search function which we call
            <c>searchFrom</c>. The code is shown in <xref ref="lst-mazesearch"/>. Notice
            that this function takes three parameters: a maze object, the starting
            row, and the starting column. This is important because as a recursive
            function the search logically starts again with each recursive call.</p>

            searchFrom(maze, startRow, startColumn + 1)

    # 6. Mark the location as either part of the path or a dead end,
    # depending on whether or not an exit has been found.
    if found:
        maze[startRow][startColumn] = MAZE_PATH
    else:

        <p>As you look through the algorithm you will see that the first thing the
            code does (steps 1 and 2) is determine if the space <em>should be visited</em>.
            This is done by checking if the spot is an obstacle (<c>MAZE_OBSTACLE</c>),
            or has already been visited (<c>MAZE_TRIED</c>). The algorithm then
            determines if it has found an exit (step 3). If none of these cases
            are true, it continues the search recursively.</p>
        <p>You will notice that in the recursive step there are four recursive
            calls to <c>searchFrom</c>. It is hard to predict how many of these
            recursive calls will be used since they are all connected by <c>or</c>
            statements. If the first call to <c>searchFrom</c> returns <c>True</c> then
            none of the last three calls would be needed. You can interpret this as
            meaning that a step to <c>(row-1,column)</c> (or North if you want to think
            geographically) is on the path leading out of the maze. If there is not
            a good path leading out of the maze to the North then the next recursive
            call is tried, this one to the South. If South fails then try West, and
            finally East. If all four recursive calls return false then we have
            found a dead end. You should download or type in the whole program and
            experiment with it by changing the order of these calls.</p>
        <p>The code for the <c>Maze</c> class is shown in <xref ref="lst-maze"/> and <xref ref="completemaze"/>.
            The <c>__init__</c> method takes the name of a file as its
            only parameter. This file is a text file that represents a maze by using
            <q>+</q> characters for walls, spaces for open squares, and the letter <q>S</q> to
            indicate the starting position. <xref ref="fig-exmaze"/> is an example of a
            maze data file. The internal representation of the maze is a list of
            lists. Each row of the <c>mazeList</c> instance variable is also a list.
            This secondary list contains one character per square using the
            characters described above. For the data file in <xref ref="lst-exmaze"/> the
            internal representation looks like the following:</p>
        <listing xml:id="lst-exmaze">

        <p>Finally, the <c>isOnEdge</c> method uses our current position
            to test for an exit condition. An exit condition occurs whenever we
            have navigated to the edge of the maze, either row zero or column zero,
            or the far right column or the bottom row.</p>

            <p>Now that you're familiar with this simple maze exploring algorithm, use what you've learned about file handling, classes, and IO to implement this in C++!
                To visualize the exploration, print out the characters using <c>cout</c> to create an ASCII representation of your cave. For example, your program should be able to read and operate from a file formatted as follows:
                You can also use CTurtle to visualize the traversal throughout the maze.</p>
