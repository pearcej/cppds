        <title>Implementing an Unordered Linked List</title>
        
        <p><idx>linked list</idx> A <term>linked list</term> is a linear collection of data elements whose order
            is not determined by the placement in memory. Instead, each element is stored
            in a node which points to the next node.
            In the next sections we implement this linked list data structure.
            In doing so, we need to be sure that
            we can maintain the relative positioning of the items. However, there is
            no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous memory.
            For example, consider the collection of items shown in
            <xref ref="fig-idea"/>. It appears that these values have been placed
            randomly. If we can maintain some explicit information in each item,
            namely the location of the next item (see <xref ref="fig-idea2"/>), then the
            relative position of each item can be expressed by simply following the
            link from one item to the next.</p>

                <description>Image displaying a scattered set of numbers representing items not constrained in their physical placement. The numbers shown are '31' and '17' at the top, '26' to the right, '54' and '77' in the middle, and '93' at the bottom. They are arranged without a discernible pattern or alignment, suggesting a random or unstructured layout.</description>

                <description>Diagram showing a sequence of numbers connected by arrows, illustrating relative positions maintained by explicit links. The sequence starts with 'Head' pointing to '54', which links to '77', then to '31' labeled '(End)', '17', '26', and finally '93'. The arrows signify the direction of the linkage between the elements, depicting a linked structure. Captioned 'Figure 4.3.2. Relative Positions Maintained by Explicit Links'.</description>

        <p>It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list
            must be explicitly specified. Once we know where the first item is, the
            first item can tell us where the second is, and so on. <idx>head</idx> The external
            reference is often referred to as the <term>head</term> of the list. Similarly,
            the last item needs to know that there is no next item.</p>
