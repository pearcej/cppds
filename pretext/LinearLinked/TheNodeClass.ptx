  <title>The <c>Node</c> Class</title>
  <p>The basic building block for the linked list implementation is the
            <term>node</term>. Each node object must hold at least two pieces of information.
            First, the node must contain the list item itself. We will call this the
            <term>data field</term> of the node. In addition, each node must hold a reference
            to the next node. <xref ref="linear-linked_lst-nodeclass"/> shows the C++
            implementation. To construct a node, you need to supply the initial data
            value for the node. Evaluating the assignment statement below will yield
            a node object containing the value 93 (see <xref ref="id1-fig-node"/>). You
            should note that we will typically represent a node object as shown in
            <xref ref="id2-fig-node2"/>. The <c>Node</c> class also includes the usual methods
            to access and modify the data and the next reference.</p>

  <p>The special C++ reference value <c>NULL</c> will play an important role
            in the <c>Node</c> class and later in the linked list itself. A reference
            to <c>NULL</c> will denote the fact that there is no next node.</p>
  <p>Note:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>in the constructor that a node is initially created with <c>next</c> and a pointer to
                <c>NULL</c>. Since this is sometimes referred to as <q>grounding the node,</q>
                we will use the standard ground symbol to denote a reference that is
                referring to <c>NULL</c>.</p>

        <p>
            An illustration of a node object in a linked list. The node contains two components: a &quot;data&quot; field holding the value &quot;93&quot; 
            and a &quot;next&quot; field representing a reference to the next node in the list. A variable named &quot;temp&quot; points to this node, 
            and an arrow originating from the &quot;next&quot; field extends to indicate a link to the subsequent node in the list.

        <p>
            A simplified representation of a node in a linked list. The node is depicted as a rectangular block containing the value &quot;93.&quot; 
            A variable named &quot;temp&quot; points to this block. An arrow extends from the right side of the block to represent the reference 
            to the next node in the list, maintaining the linked list structure.
