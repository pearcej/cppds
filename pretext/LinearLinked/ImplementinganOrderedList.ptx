            <statement>
             <p>
              An <term>ordered linked list</term> is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of nodes, each containing two main components: a data element, often referred to as the "value" or "key", and a "reference" or "link" to the next node in the sequence. These nodes are organized in a specific order based on the values of their data elements, typically in ascending or descending order.
             </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>In order to implement the <term>ordered linked list</term>, we must remember that the
            relative positions of the items are based on some underlying
            characteristic. The ordered linked list of integers given above (17, 26, 31,
            54, 77, and 93) can be represented by a linked structure as shown in
            <xref ref="fig-orderlinked"/>. Again, the node and link structure is ideal
            for representing the relative positioning of the items.</p>

                <description>Image of an ordered linked list with rectangular nodes connected by arrows. The list begins with a node labeled 'head' pointing to '17', followed by sequential nodes labeled '26', '31', '54', '77', and '93', with arrows indicating the direction of linkage from left to right. The structure represents a series of linked elements in ascending order.</description>

            </figure>
        
        <p>To implement the <c>OrderedList</c> class, we will use the same technique
            as seen previously with unordered linked lists. Once again, an empty linked list will
            be denoted by a <c>head</c> reference to <c>NULL</c> (see
            <xref ref="lst-orderlist"/>).</p>
        
        <p xml:id="linear-linked_lst-orderlist" names="lst_orderlist"><term>Listing 8</term></p>
        <pre>class OrderedList {
    Node* head;
}</pre>
        <p>As we consider the operations for the ordered linked list, we should note that
            the <c>isEmpty</c> and <c>size</c> methods can be implemented the same as
            with unordered linked lists since they deal only with the number of nodes in
            the linked list without regard to the actual item values. Likewise, the
            <c>remove</c> method will work just fine since we still need to find the
            item and then link around the node to remove it. The two remaining
            methods, <c>search</c> and <c>add</c>, will require some modification.</p>
        <p>The search of an unordered linked list required that we traverse the
            nodes one at a time until we either find the item we are looking for or
            run out of nodes (<c>NULL</c>). It turns out that the same approach would
            actually work with the ordered linked list and in fact in the case where we
            find the item it is exactly what we need. However, in the case where the
            item is not in the linked list, we can take advantage of the ordering to stop
            the search as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>For example, <xref ref="fig-stopearly"/> shows the ordered linked list as a
            search is looking for the value 45. As we traverse, starting at the head
            of the linked list, we first compare against 17. Since 17 is not the item we
            are looking for, we move to the next node, in this case 26. Again, this
            is not what we want, so we move on to 31 and then on to 54. Now, at this
            point, something is different. Since 54 is not the item we are looking
            for, our former strategy would be to move forward. However, due to the
            fact that this is an ordered linked list, that will not be necessary. Once the
            value in the node becomes greater than the item we are searching for,
            the search can stop and return <c>False</c>. There is no way the item could
            exist further out in the linked list.</p>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-stopearly">

                <description>Diagram showing the process of searching an ordered linked list. The list includes rectangular nodes with numbers '17', '26', '31', '54', '77', and '93' connected by arrows from a 'head' node. Above each node except 'head' and '93', a dashed arrow points down, labeled 'current', indicating the position being checked. Over the '54' node, there is a magnifying glass symbol, suggesting it is the current focus of the search. The list is terminated by a vertical bar symbol.</description>
                </image>
            </figure>

        <p><xref ref="lst-ordersearch"/> shows the complete <c>search</c> method. It is
            easy to incorporate the new condition discussed above by adding another
            boolean variable, <c>stop</c>, and initializing it to <c>False</c> (line 4).
            While <c>stop</c> is <c>False</c> (in other words, while the search is still ongoing) we can continue to look
            forward in the linked list (line 5). If any node is ever discovered that
            contains data greater than the item we are looking for, we will set
            <c>stop</c> to <c>True</c> (lines 9&#8211;10). The remaining lines are identical to
            the unordered linked list search.</p>
        
        <p xml:id="linear-linked_lst-ordersearch" names="lst_ordersearch"><term>Listing 9</term></p>
        <pre>bool search(int item) {
    Node *current = head;
    bool found = false;
    bool stop = false;
    while (current != NULL &amp;&amp; !found &amp;&amp; !stop) {
        if (current-&gt;getData() == item) {
            found = true;
        } else {
            if (current-&gt;getData() &gt; item) {
                stop = true;
            } else {
                current = current-&gt;getNext();
            }
        }
    }

    return found;
}</pre>
        <p>The most significant method modification will take place in <c>add</c>.
            Recall that for unordered linked lists, the <c>add</c> method could simply place a
            new node at the head of the linked list. It was the easiest point of access.
            Unfortunately, this will no longer work with ordered linked lists. It is now
            necessary that we discover the specific place where a new item belongs
            in the existing ordered linked list.</p>
        <p>Assume we have the ordered linked list consisting of 17, 26, 54, 77, and 93 and
            we want to add the value 31. The <c>add</c> method must decide that the new
            item belongs between 26 and 54. <xref ref="fig-orderinsert"/> shows the setup
            that we need. As we explained earlier, we need to traverse the linked
            list looking for the place where the new node will be added. We know we
            have found that place when either we run out of nodes (<c>current</c>
            becomes <c>NULL</c>) or the value of the current node becomes greater than
            the item we wish to add. In our example, seeing the value 54 causes us
            to stop.</p>
        
        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-orderinsert">
            <caption>Adding an Item to an Ordered Linked List.</caption>
                <image source="LinearLinked/linkedlistinsert.png" width="80%">
                <description>Diagram of an ordered linked list illustrating the addition of a new item. The list starts with 'head' pointing to '17', then '26', followed by '54', '77', and '93', ending with a vertical bar symbol. A separate node labeled '31' with an arrow pointing right is positioned below, with a label 'temp'. Dashed arrows labeled 'Step 1' and 'Step 2' show the process of inserting '31' between '26' and '54'. Arrows from above point to '26' and '54' labeled 'previous' and 'current' respectively, indicating their positions relative to the insertion. </description>
                </image>
            </figure>

        <p>As we saw with unordered linked lists, it is necessary to have an additional
            reference, again called <c>previous</c>, since <c>current</c> will not provide
            access to the node that must be modified. <xref ref="lst-orderadd"/> shows
            the complete <c>add</c> method. Lines 2&#8211;3 set up the two external
            references and lines 9&#8211;10 again allow <c>previous</c> to follow one node
            behind <c>current</c> every time through the iteration. The condition (line
            5) allows the iteration to continue as long as there are more nodes and
            the value in the current node is not larger than the item. In either
            case, when the iteration fails, we have found the location for the new
            node.</p>
        <p>The remainder of the method completes the two-step process shown in
            <xref ref="fig-orderinsert"/>. Once a new node has been created for the item,
            the only remaining question is whether the new node will be added at the
            beginning of the linked list or some place in the middle. Again,
            <c>previous == NULL</c> (line 13) can be used to provide the answer.</p>

        <pre>void add(int item) {

        head = newNode;
    } else {
        Node *current = head;
        Node *previous = NULL;
        bool stop = false;
        while (current != NULL &amp;&amp; !stop) {

        <p>The <c>OrderedList</c> class with methods discussed thus far can be found
            in ActiveCode 1.
            We leave the remaining methods as exercises. You should carefully
            consider whether the unordered implementations will work given that the
            linked list is now ordered.</p>

            <title>Analysis of Linked Lists</title>
            <p>To analyze the complexity of the linked list operations, we need to
                consider whether they require traversal. Consider a linked list that has
                <em>n</em> nodes. The <c>isEmpty</c> method is <m>O(1)</m> since it requires
                one step to check the head reference for <c>NULL</c>. <c>size</c>, on the
                other hand, will always require <em>n</em> steps since there is no way to know
                how many nodes are in the linked list without traversing from head to
                end. Therefore, <c>size</c> is <m>O(n)</m>. Adding an item to an
                unordered linked list will always be O(1) since we simply place the new node at
                the head of the linked list. However, <c>search</c> and <c>remove</c>, as well
                as <c>add</c> for an ordered linked list, all require the traversal process.
                Although on average they may need to traverse only half of the nodes,
                these methods are all <m>O(n)</m> since in the worst case each will
                process every node in the linked list.</p>
