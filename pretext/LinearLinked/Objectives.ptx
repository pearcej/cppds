        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>To appreciate that list-like data types such as arrays and vectors which rely on storing data in contiguous memory are just one type of list-like structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To learn that linked lists are a different list-like data structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To write code which manipulates linked lists in C++.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Understand node and pointer diagrams to illustrate the linked list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To learn how singly and doubly linked lists are implemented in C++.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To understand the abstract data types node and linked list, including the unordered list and ordered list.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
