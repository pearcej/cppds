    <title>The <c>Unordered Linked List</c> Class</title>

    <p>As we suggested above, the <term>unordered linked list</term>
        will be built from a collection of nodes, each linked to the next by explicit
        pointers. As long as we know where to find the first node (containing the first
        item), each item after that can be found by successively following the
        next links. With this in mind, the <c>UnorderedList</c> class must maintain
        a reference to the first node. <xref ref="unordered-constructor"/> shows the
        constructor. Note that each list object will maintain a single reference
        to the head of the list.</p>

    <listing xml:id="unordered-constructor">

        <program language="cpp" label="unordered-constructor-prog"><code>
class UnorderedList {
    public:
        Node *head;

        UnorderedList() {

        }
};

    <p>Initially when we construct a list, there are no items. The assignment and declaration statment</p>
    <pre>UnorderedList myList;</pre>
    <p>creates the linked list representation shown in <xref ref="fig-unordered-empty"/>.
        As we discussed in the Node class, the special reference <c>NULL</c> will again be used to state
        that the head of the list does not refer to anything. Eventually, the example list given earlier
        will be represented by a linked list as shown in <xref ref="fig-unordered-full"/>.
        The head of the list points to the first node which contains the first item of the list.
        In turn, that node holds a reference to the next node (the next item) and so on.
        It is very important to note that the list class itself does not contain any node objects.
        Instead it contains a single pointer to only the first node in the linked structure.</p>

                A diagram of a linked list with multiple elements inserted. The &quot;mylist&quot; variable points to a circular node labeled &quot;head.&quot; 
                The &quot;head&quot; node links to a sequence of rectangular nodes, each containing a data value: &quot;54,&quot; &quot;26,&quot; &quot;93,&quot; &quot;17,&quot; &quot;77,&quot; and &quot;31.&quot; 
                Each node points to the next in sequence, with the final node pointing to the end of the list, represented by a vertical line. 
                This illustrates the progression of the linked list as data is added.

    <p>The <c>isEmpty</c> method, shown in <xref ref="unordered-isempty"/>, simply checks to
        see if the head of the list is a reference to <c>NULL</c>. The result of
        the boolean expression <c>this-&gt;head==NULL</c> will only be true if there
        are no nodes in the linked list. Since a new list is empty, the
        constructor and the check for empty must be consistent with one another.
        This shows the advantage to using the reference <c>NULL</c> to denote the
        <q>end</q> of the linked structure. Two references are equal if they both refer to the same
        object. We will use this often in our remaining methods.</p>
    <listing xml:id="unordered-isempty">
        <caption><c>UnorderedList</c> <c>isEmpty()</c> method</caption>

    </listing>

    <p>So, how do we get items into our linked list? We need to implement the <c>add</c> method.
        However, before we can do that, we need to address the important question of where in
        the linked list to place the new item. Since this linked list is unordered,
        the specific location of the new item with respect to the other items already
        in the linked list is not important. The new item can go anywhere.
        With that in mind, it makes sense to place the new item in the easiest location possible.</p>

    <p>Recall that the linked list structure provides us with only one entry point,
        the head of the linked list. All of the other nodes can only be reached by accessing
        the first node and then following <c>next</c> links. This means that the easiest place to add
        the new node is right at the head, or beginning, of the linked list.
        In other words, we will make the new item the first item of the linked list and the
        existing items will need to be linked to this new first item so that they follow.</p>


    <p>The linked linked list shown in <xref ref="fig-unordered-full"/> was built by calling
        the <c>add</c> method a number of times as in <xref ref="unordered-lst-add"/>.</p>

    <listing xml:id="unordered-lst-add">
        <caption><c>UnorderedList</c> Adding Elements</caption>
        <program language="cpp" label="unordered-lst-add-prog"><code>
mylist.add(31);
mylist.add(77);
mylist.add(17);
mylist.add(93);
mylist.add(26);
mylist.add(54);
        </code></program>
    </listing>

    <p>Note that since 31 is the first item added to the linked list, it will
        eventually be the last node on the linked list as every other item is
        added ahead of it. Also, since 54 is the last item added, it will become
        the data value in the first node of the linked list.</p>

    <p>The <c>add</c> method is shown in <xref ref="unordered-add"/>. Each item of the linked list
        must reside in a node object. Line 2 creates a new node and places the
        item as its data. Now we must complete the process by linking the new
        node into the existing structure. This requires two steps as shown in
        <xref ref="fig-unordered-add-correct"/>. Step 1 (line 3) changes the <c>next</c> reference
        of the new node to refer to the old first node of the linked list. Now that the
        rest of the linked list has been properly attached to the new node, we can
        modify the head of the linked list to refer to the new node. The assignment
        statement in line 4 sets the head of the linked list.</p>

                A diagram illustrating the process of adding a new node with the value &quot;26&quot; to a linked list. The list initially starts 
                with a &quot;head&quot; pointer referencing the first node containing &quot;93.&quot; This node links to subsequent nodes with values 
                &quot;17,&quot; &quot;77,&quot; and &quot;31,&quot; ending with a vertical line that marks the end of the list. 

                The process involves two steps. In Step 1, the &quot;next&quot; field of the new node (&quot;26&quot;) is set to point to the node currently 
                referenced by the &quot;head&quot; (node &quot;93&quot;). In Step 2, the &quot;head&quot; pointer is updated to reference the new node (&quot;26&quot;), 
                effectively inserting it at the beginning of the list. The &quot;temp&quot; variable temporarily holds the new node during this process.
            </p>

    <p>The order of the two steps described above is very important. What
    happens if the order of line 3 and line 4 is reversed? If the
    modification of the head of the linked list happens first, the result can be
    seen in <xref ref="fig-unordered-add-wrong"/>. Since the head was the only external
    reference to the linked list nodes, all of the original nodes are lost and can
    no longer be accessed.</p>

                The &quot;head&quot; pointer is updated to reference the new node (&quot;26&quot;) without first preserving a reference to the original head node (&quot;93&quot;). 
                The original linked list, consisting of nodes &quot;93,&quot; &quot;17,&quot; &quot;77,&quot; and &quot;31,&quot; becomes disconnected, with no external reference to it, 
                as indicated by the dashed oval labeled &quot;no external reference.&quot; 
                The new node (&quot;26&quot;) points to the end of the list, represented by a vertical line, making it the only accessible node in the structure. 
                The &quot;temp&quot; variable temporarily holds the new node during this process.

    <p>The next methods that we will implement <mdash/> <c>size</c>, <c>search</c>, and
        <c>remove</c> <mdash/> are all based on a technique known as
        <term>linked list traversal</term>. Traversal refers to the process of
        systematically visiting each node. To do this we use an external reference
        that starts at the first node in the linked list. As we visit each node,
        we move the reference to the next node by <q>traversing</q> the next reference.</p>

    <p>To implement the <c>size</c> method, we need to traverse the linked list
        and keep a count of the number of nodes that occurred.
        <xref ref="unordered-size"/> shows the C++ code for counting the number of
        nodes in the linked list. The external reference is called <c>current</c> and is
        initialized to the head of the linked list in line<nbsp/>2. At the start of the
        process we have not seen any nodes so the count is set to <m>0</m>.
        Lines 4<ndash/>6 actually implement the traversal. As long as the current
        reference has not seen the end of the linked list (<c>NULL</c>), we move current
        along to the next node via the assignment statement in line 6. Again,
        the ability to compare a reference to <c>NULL</c> is very useful. Every
        time current moves to a new node, we add <m>1</m> to <c>count</c>.
        Finally, <c>count</c> gets returned after the iteration stops.
        <xref ref="fig-traversal"/> shows this process as it proceeds down the linked list.</p>

                The traversal process is indicated by an arrow labeled &quot;traversal,&quot; moving from left to right. A variable labeled &quot;current&quot; sequentially points to each node, 
                starting at the &quot;head&quot; and progressing through each node in the list until it reaches the end marker. Dashed arrows illustrate the movement of the &quot;current&quot; pointer

    <p>Searching for a value in a linked list implementation of an unordered
        linked list also uses the traversal technique. As we visit each node in the
        linked list we will ask whether the data stored there matches the item
        we are looking for. In this case, however, we may not have to traverse
        all the way to the end of the linked list. In fact, if we do get to the end of
        the linked list, that means that the item we are looking for must not be
        present. Also, if we do find the item, there is no need to continue.</p>
    
    <p><xref ref="unordered-search"/> shows the implementation for the <c>search</c> method.
        As in the <c>size</c> method, the traversal is initialized to start at
        the head of the linked list (line 2). As long as there are
        more nodes to visit and we have not found the item we are looking for,
        we continue to check the next node. The question in line 4 asks whether
        the data item is present in the current node. If so, we return <c>true</c>.
        When we reach the end of the list and the item has not been found, we return <c>false</c>.</p>

    <listing xml:id="unordered-search">
        <caption><c>UnorderedList</c> <c>search</c> Method</caption>

    <pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist.search(17);
1
    </pre>

    <p>Since 17 is in the linked list, the traversal process needs to move only to the
        node containing 17. At that point, the variable <c>found</c> is set to
        <c>true</c> and the <c>while</c> condition will fail, leading to the return
        value seen above. This process can be seen in <xref ref="fig-unordered-search"/>.</p>

    <p>The <c>remove</c> method requires two logical steps. First, we need to
        traverse the linked list looking for the item we want to remove. Once we find
        the item (recall that we assume it is present), we must remove it. The
        first step is very similar to <c>search</c>. Starting with an external
        reference set to the head of the linked list, we traverse the links until we
        discover the item we are looking for. Since we assume that item is
        present, we know that the iteration will stop before <c>current</c> gets to
        <c>NULL</c>. This means that we can simply use the boolean <c>found</c> in the
        condition.</p>
    
    <p>When <c>found</c> becomes <c>true</c>, <c>current</c> will be a reference to the
        node containing the item to be removed. But how do we remove it? One
        possibility would be to replace the value of the item with some marker
        that suggests that the item is no longer present. The problem with this
        approach is the number of nodes will no longer match the number of
        items. It would be much better to remove the item by removing the entire
        node.</p>
    
    <p>In order to remove the node containing the item, we need to modify the
        link in the previous node so that it refers to the node that comes after
        <c>current</c>. Unfortunately, there is no way to go backward in the linked
        list. Since <c>current</c> refers to the node ahead of the node where we
        would like to make the change, it is too late to make the necessary
        modification.</p>
    
    <p>The solution to this dilemma is to use two external references as we
        traverse down the linked list. <c>current</c> will behave just as it did
        before, marking the current location of the traverse. The new reference,
        which we will call <c>previous</c>, will always travel one node behind
        <c>current</c>. That way, when <c>current</c> stops at the node to be removed,
        <c>previous</c> will be referring to the proper place in the linked list
        for the modification.</p>
    
    <p><xref ref="unordered-remove"/> shows the complete <c>remove</c> method. Lines 2<ndash/>3
        assign initial values to the two references. Note that <c>current</c>
        starts out at the linked list head as in the other traversal examples.
        <c>previous</c>, however, is assumed to always travel one node behind
        current. For this reason, <c>previous</c> starts out with a value of
        <c>NULL</c> since there is no node before the head (see
        <xref ref="fig-unordered-removeinit"/>). The boolean variable <c>found</c> will again be
        used to control the iteration.</p>

                Two variables, &quot;current&quot; and &quot;previous,&quot; are introduced for the removal process. The &quot;current&quot; variable initially points to the &quot;head&quot; node, 
                while the &quot;previous&quot; variable points to the null marker (indicated by a vertical line before the &quot;head&quot;). These pointers will be used to traverse

        A diagram showing the step-by-step process of removing a node (&quot;17&quot;) from a linked list. The list begins with a &quot;head&quot; pointer referencing the first node, 
        which contains the value &quot;54,&quot; followed by nodes with values &quot;26,&quot; &quot;93,&quot; &quot;17,&quot; &quot;77,&quot; and &quot;31,&quot; ending with a vertical line.

        The process is illustrated in four steps, labeled &quot;Step 0&quot; to &quot;Step 3.&quot; 
        - In Step 0, the &quot;current&quot; pointer starts at the &quot;head&quot; node (&quot;54&quot;), and the &quot;previous&quot; pointer is set to null. 
        - In subsequent steps, both &quot;current&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; pointers traverse the list. The &quot;current&quot; pointer moves to each node sequentially 
          while the &quot;previous&quot; pointer follows behind. 
        - By Step 3, &quot;current&quot; points to the target node (&quot;17&quot;), and &quot;previous&quot; points to the preceding node (&quot;93&quot;). 
          At this step, the traversal stops.

    <p>Once the searching step of the <c>remove</c> has been completed, we need to
        remove the node from the linked list. <xref ref="fig-unordered-remove"/> shows the
        link that must be modified. However, there is a special case that needs
        to be addressed. If the item to be removed happens to be the first item
        in the linked list, then <c>current</c> will reference the first node in the
        linked list. This also means that <c>previous</c> will be <c>NULL</c>. We said
        earlier that <c>previous</c> would be referring to the node whose next
        reference needs to be modified in order to complete the remove. In this
        case, it is not <c>previous</c> but rather the head of the linked list that needs
        to be changed (see <xref ref="fig-unordered-removehead"/>).</p>

                A diagram showing the actual removal of the node with the value &quot;17&quot; from the middle of a linked list. 
                The &quot;current&quot; pointer is positioned on the node with the value &quot;17,&quot; which is to be removed, while the &quot;previous&quot; pointer points to the preceding node 
                (&quot;93&quot;). The &quot;next&quot; reference of the &quot;previous&quot; node is updated to skip the &quot;current&quot; node and point directly to the node after (&quot;77&quot;). 
                This effectively removes the &quot;17&quot; node from the linked list while maintaining the proper structure of the list.

                A diagram illustrating the removal of the first node (&quot;head&quot;) from a linked list. The list starts with the &quot;head&quot; pointer referencing the first node, 
                which contains the value &quot;54,&quot; followed by nodes with values &quot;26,&quot; &quot;93,&quot; &quot;17,&quot; &quot;77,&quot; and &quot;31,&quot; ending with a vertical line.

                The &quot;current&quot; pointer is positioned on the first node (&quot;54&quot;), which is to be removed. The &quot;previous&quot; pointer is initially set to a null 
                reference, indicating the absence of a preceding node. The &quot;head&quot; pointer is updated to reference the next node (&quot;26&quot;), effectively removing 
                the first node from the list while maintaining the integrity of the linked list structure.

    <p>Line 12 allows us to check whether we are dealing with the special case
        described above. If <c>previous</c> did not move, it will still have the
        value <c>NULL</c> when the boolean <c>found</c> becomes <c>true</c>. In that case
        (line 13) the head of the linked list is modified to refer to the node after
        the current node, in effect removing the first node from the linked
        list. However, if previous is not <c>NULL</c>, the node to be removed is
        somewhere down the linked list structure. In this case the previous
        reference is providing us with the node whose next reference must be
        changed. Line 15 uses the <c>setNext</c> method from <c>previous</c> to
        accomplish the removal. Note that in both cases the destination of the
        reference change is <c>current.getNext()</c>. One question that often
        arises is whether the two cases shown here will also handle the
        situation where the item to be removed is in the last node of the linked
        list. We leave that for you to consider.</p>
