                <p>The alternative implementation of the <c>Queue</c> ADT is to use a list
                    such that the rear of the queue is at the end of the list. What would
                    this mean for Big-O performance?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What is the result of carrying out both steps of the linked list
                    <c>add</c> method in reverse order? What kind of reference results? What
                    types of problems may result?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Explain how the linked list <c>remove</c> method works when the item to
                    be removed is in the last node.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Explain how the <c>remove</c> method works when the item is in the
                    <em>only</em> node in the linked list.</p>
