        <title>Performance of C++ Data Collections</title>
        <p>Now that you have a general idea of Big-O notation
            and the differences between the different functions, our goal in this
            section is to tell you about the Big-O performance for the operations on
            C++ data structures such as vectors, strings, and hash tables.
            We will also show you some timing
            experiments that illustrate the costs and benefits of using certain
            operations on each data structure. It is important for you to understand
            the efficiency of these C++ data structures because they are the
            building blocks we will use as we implement other data structures in the
            remainder of the book. In this section we are not going to explain why
            the performance is what it is. In later chapters you will see some
            possible implementations of both arrays and hash tables and how the
            performance depends on the implementation.</p>
