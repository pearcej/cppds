    <title>What Is Algorithm Analysis?</title>
    <p>It is very common for beginning computer science students to
        compare their programs with one another. You may also have noticed that
        it is common for computer programs to look very similar, especially the
        simple ones. An interesting question often arises. When two programs
        solve the same problem but look different, is one program better than
        the other?</p>
    <p>In order to answer this question, we need to remember that there is an
        important difference between a program and the underlying algorithm that
        the program is representing. As we stated in Chapter 1, an <term>algorithm</term> is
        a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem. It
        is a method for solving any instance of the problem such that given a
        particular input, the algorithm produces the desired result. A 
        <idx>program</idx>
        <term>program</term>,
        on the other hand, is an algorithm that has been encoded into some
        programming language. There may be many programs for the same algorithm,
        depending on the programmer and the programming language being used.</p>
    <p>To explore this difference further, consider the function shown in
        <xref ref="lst-sum0"/>. This function solves a familiar problem, computing the
        sum of the first <em>n</em> integers. The algorithm uses the idea of an
        accumulator variable that is initialized to 0. The solution then
        iterates through the <em>n</em> integers, adding each to the accumulator.</p>

    <p>Now look at the function in <xref ref="lst-sum2"/>.
        At first glance it may look
        strange, but upon further inspection you can see that this function is
        essentially doing the same thing as the previous one. The reason this is
        not obvious is poor coding. We did not use good identifier names to
        assist with readability, and we used an extra assignment statement
        during the accumulation step that was not really necessary.</p>

    <p>The question we raised earlier asked whether one function is better than
        another. The answer depends on your criteria. The function <c>sumOfN</c> is
        certainly better than the function <c>foo</c> if you are concerned with
        readability. In fact, you have probably seen many examples of this in
        your introductory programming course since one of the goals there is to
        help you write programs that are easy to read and easy to understand. In
        this course, however, we are also interested in characterizing the
        algorithm itself. (We certainly hope that you will continue to strive to
        write readable, understandable code.)</p>
    <p>Algorithm analysis is concerned with comparing algorithms based upon the
        amount of computing resources that each algorithm uses. We want to be
        able to consider two algorithms and say that one is better than the
        other because it is more efficient in its use of those resources or
        perhaps because it simply uses fewer. From this perspective, the two
        functions above seem very similar. They both use essentially the same
        algorithm to solve the summation problem.</p>
    <p>At this point, it is important to think more about what we really mean
        by computing resources. There are two different ways to look at this.
        One way is to consider the amount of space or memory an algorithm
        requires to solve the problem. The amount of space required by a problem
        solution is typically dictated by the problem instance itself. Every so
        often, however, there are algorithms that have very specific space
        requirements, and in those cases we will be very careful to explain the
        variations.</p>
    <p>As an alternative to space requirements, we can analyze and compare
        algorithms based on the amount of time they require to execute. This
        measure is sometimes referred to as the <q>execution time</q> or <q>running
        time</q> of the algorithm. One way we can measure the execution time for
        the function <c>sumOfN</c> is to do a benchmark analysis. This means that
        we will track the actual time required for the program to compute its
        result. In C++, we can benchmark a function by noting the starting
        time and ending time with respect to the system we are using. In the
        <c>ctime</c> library there is a function called <c>clock</c> that will return the
        current system clock time in seconds since some arbitrary starting
        point. By calling this function twice, at the beginning and at the end,
        and then computing the difference, we can get an exact number of seconds
        (fractions in most cases) for execution.</p>

        <p>This is the sigma symbol: <m>\sum_{}</m>.
            It tells us that we are summing up something
            much like a mathematical loop typically with a counter.</p>
        <p>If we have
            <m>\sum_{i=1}^{5}</m>
            the bottom index <title_reference>i=1</title_reference> tells us that the index <title_reference>i</title_reference> begins at 1
            and that <title_reference>i</title_reference> will terminate at <title_reference>5</title_reference>.</p>
        <p>What ever comes immediately afterwards is what
            we are summing. So,
            <m>\sum_{i=1}^{5} i</m>
            tells us to add the integers <m>1+2+3+4+5</m>
            because just like in a <title_reference>for</title_reference> loop, we plug a value for each <title_reference>i</title_reference> value.
            Similarly, <m>\sum_{i=2}^{4} i^2</m> means <m>2^2+3^2+4^2</m>.</p>

        <title>Applying the Math Notation</title>
        <p>There is often more than one way to solve a problem.
            Let's consider the blue area in the
            following <m>8 \times 9</m>.rectangle.</p>

        <figure align="center" xml:id="fig-sumof-n-integers">
            <caption>Sum of <title_reference>n = 8</title_reference> integers</caption>
                <image source="AlgorithmAnalysis/sumof-n-integers.png" width="50%">
                    <description>This figure illustrates the sum of eight integers (Figure 1). Examining the blue area within the rectangle highlights various problem-solving approaches. The visual representation provides clarity, showcasing the intricacies involved in calculating the sum and emphasizing the value of diverse perspectives in mathematical problem-solving.</description>
                </image>
        </figure>

        <p>To find the blue area, we can count the number of blue squares
            <m>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8</m>, which we just learned
            can be written as <m>\sum_{i=1}^{8} i.</m>
            However, we also know how to find the area of a rectangle,
            by multiplying height by width, and the blue squares represent
            half of the rectangle.
            So, the area with blue squares
            is also just <m>\sum_{i=1}^{8} i = \frac {(8)(8+1)}{2}</m>.</p>
        <p>Hence, when we have a variable <title_reference>n</title_reference>, we have learned that we can just use the
            closed equation <m>\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac {(n)(n+1)}{2}</m> to
            compute the sum of the first <c>n</c> integers without iterating.</p>
        <p>Consider the following function:</p>
        <pre>int sumOfN3(int n){
int sum_n = (n*(n+1))/2; // how many times?
return sum_n;
}</pre>

             <p>We see this in <xref ref="algorithm-analysis_active3cpp"/>,

Sum is 50005000 required 0.000001 seconds
Sum is 50005000 required 0.000000 seconds</pre>
        <p>There are two important things to notice about this output. First, the
            times recorded above are shorter than any of the previous examples.
            Second, they are very consistent no matter what the value of <c>n</c>. It
            appears that <c>sumOfN3</c> is hardly impacted by the number of integers
            being added.</p>
        <p>But what does this benchmark really tell us? Intuitively, we can see
            that the iterative solutions seem to be doing more work since some
            program steps are being repeated. This is likely the reason it is taking
            longer. Also, the time required for the iterative solution seems to
            increase as we increase the value of <c>n</c>. However, there is a problem.
            If we run the same function on a different computer or used a different
            programming language, we would likely get different results. It could
            take even longer to perform <c>sumOfN3</c> if the computer were older.</p>
        <p>We need a better way to characterize these algorithms with respect to
            execution time. The benchmark technique computes the actual time to
            execute. It does not really provide us with a useful measurement,
            because it is dependent on a particular machine, program, time of day,
            compiler, and programming language. Instead, we would like to have a
            characterization that is independent of the program or computer being
            used. This measure would then be useful for judging the algorithm alone
            and could be used to compare algorithms across implementations.</p>
