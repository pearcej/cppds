        <title>Analysis of Array and Vector Operators</title>
        <p>As we know, <idx>vectors</idx><term>vectors</term> use <idx>contiguous</idx><term>contiguous</term> storage locations
            in an underlying (typically larger) array.
            Both array and vector elements can be accessed and
            traversed with the help of iterators, and they
            can also be accessed randomly using indexes.</p>
        <p>However, unlike basic arrays, vectors have a <idx>dynamic size</idx><term>dynamic size</term> meaning that whenever
            a new element is inserted or deleted,
            their size changes automatically.
            A new element can be inserted into or deleted from any part of a vector,
            and automatic reallocation for other existing items in the vector is applied.
            Nevertheless, computing time for
            insertion and deletion might differ depending on the location of the item,
            and how many items need to be
            reallocated.
            For example, the last item in a vector is typically
            removed at a constant time,
            because no resizing of
            the vector is typically needed for this operation,
            while an item is removed or inserted into the beginning or the
            middle of a vector at a linear time because all of the remaining
            items to the right of that element must be shifted.</p>
        <p>Two common operations for both arrays and vectors
            are indexing and assigning to an index position
            that already exists.
            Both of these operations take the same amount of time no matter how
            large the array or vector is. When an operation like this is independent of
            the size of the array or vector they are <m>O(1)</m>.</p>
        <p>Although not possible with basic arrays, a common programming technique is growing a vector.
            As we have seen, one
            way to create a longer vector is to use the <c>push_back()</c> method.
            The <c>push_back()</c> method is typically <m>O(1)</m>, provided
            there is adequate capacity in the underlying array.</p>
        <p>First we'll use <c>push_back()</c> method.
            <xref ref="ls_mkvectcpp"/> shows the code for
            making our vector.</p>

        <p>To capture the time it takes for each of our functions to execute we
            will use C++'s <c>ctime</c> module. The <c>ctime</c> module is designed
            to allow C++ developers to make cross-platform timing measurements by
            running functions in a consistent environment and using timing
            mechanisms that are as similar as possible across operating systems.</p>
        <p>To use <c>ctime</c> you create two <c>clock</c> objects. The first clock object marks
            the current start time; the second clock object marks the current time after
            the function runs a set number of times (the end time). To get the total runtime,
            you subtract the end time from the start time to get the elapsed time.
            The following session shows how long it takes to run each
            of our test functions 10,000 times within a <c>for</c> loop.</p>

        <p>In the experiment above the statement that we are timing is the function
            call to <c>test1</c>. From the experiment, we see the amount of time taken by the push_back operation.
            Not only is the <c>push_back()</c> function call duration being measured, but the time to allocate space is being measured.</p>
        <p>We can improve the runtime a bit further by setting an adequate reserve for the vector
            in advance. Doing this will keep us from having to move the entire vector to an
            adequately sized space in memory.</p>

        <p>Now that we have seen how performance can be measured concretely you can
            look at <xref ref="algorithm_analysis_algorithm_analysis_tbl_vectbigocpp"/> to see the Big-O efficiency of all the
            basic vector operations. When <c>pop_back()</c> is called, the element
            at the end of the vector is removed and it typically takes
            <m>O(1)</m> but when <c>erase()</c> is called on the first element in the vector
            or anywhere in the middle it is <m>O(n)</m>. The reason for this lies
            in how C++ chooses to implement vectors. When an item is taken from the
            front of the vector, in C++ implementation, all the other elements in
            the vector are shifted one position closer to the beginning. This may seem
            silly to you now, but if you look at <xref ref="algorithm_analysis_algorithm_analysis_tbl_vectbigocpp"/> you will see
            that this implementation also allows the index operation to be
            <m>O(1)</m>. This is a tradeoff that the C++ implementers thought
            was a good one.</p>

        <p>The <c>push_back()</c> operation is <m>O(1)</m> unless there is inadequate capacity,
            in which case the entire
            vector is moved to a larger contiguous underlying array, which
            is <m>O(n)</m>.</p>
        <p>As a way of demonstrating the difference in performance between <c>push_back</c>
            and <c>insert</c>, let's do
            another experiment using the <c>ctime</c> module. Our goal is to be able
            to verify the performance of the <c>pop_back()</c> operation on a vector of a known
            size when the program pops from the end of the vector using <c>pop_back()</c>, and again when the
            program pops from the beginning of the vector using <c>erase()</c>. We will also want to
            measure this time for vectors of different sizes. What we would expect to
            see is that the time required to pop from the end of the vector will stay
            constant even as the vector grows in size, while the time to pop from the
            beginning of the vector will continue to increase as the vector grows.</p>
        <p><xref ref="lst_popmeascpp"/> shows one attempt to measure the difference
            between the <c>pop_back()</c> and <c>erase()</c>.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of things to notice about <xref ref="lst_popmeascpp"/>.
            This approach allows us to time just the single <c>pop_back()</c> statement
            and get the most accurate measure of the time for that single operation.
            Because the timer repeats 10,000 times it is also important to point out
            that the vector is decreasing in size by 1 each time through the loop.</p>
